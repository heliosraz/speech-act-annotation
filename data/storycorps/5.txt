HOST:
On March 1st, 1954, Rafael Cancel Miranda and 3 other Puerto Rican Nationalists opened fire in the House of Representatives calling for the island’s independence.
Several congressmen were injured and Cancel Miranda served 25 years in prison until President Carter commuted his sentence in 1979.
At StoryCorps, his wife, María de los Ángeles Vázquez and their son, Rafael Cancel Vázquez remembered him.
María de los Ángeles Vázquez (MAV) and Rafael Cancel Vázquez (RCV)
MAV: It was presented to the public that the people that took part in that act were crazy. Rafael was sent to Alcatraz, and they were forgotten.
RCV:  So, how did you meet papá, and how did you fall in love?
MAV: [laughs] Well, it wasn’t until the 70s, that people started talking about these four Puerto Ricans that were imprisoned in the States. They had been in jail already for about 20 years. And there was this big campaign to send a Christmas card to Nationalists. So I sent him a picture of an orchid.
And he wrote back, to my surprise, telling me how thankful he was because he had forgotten that flower pots existed. You know, I thought ‘Gosh this man has been in jail for so many years and he is still moved by a flower pot.’
RCV: When I was growing up there was always orchids at our house.
MAV: Uh huh.
RCV: But I just thought that you loved orchids. I didn’t know that it was very special for him too. 
MAV: Sí.
RCV: You know, when I was a little kid, I had no clue about what Dad did. I just knew that whenever we went somewhere, everybody wanted an autograph, a picture or like, ‘Oh, Don Rafa, it’s an honor to meet you.’ And I was like, ‘Wow, my dad is so cool. He’s cooler than yours.’ [laughs]
MAV: After you learned about March 1st, ‘54, did that change your relationship with your father? 
RCV: Of course, some of the things when I was a little kid then made more sense. He would always be in state of alert. For example, when he would take me to eat, I would always notice that he would sit in a way that he could look at the exit. 
And he would say, ‘Hijo, siempre mira pa todos lados,’ like, ‘Always look everywhere.’
But, he was always so loving and gentle and kind, so I remember asking, like, ‘Dad. How on Earth did you grab a gun and started shooting people?’ And he told me about when he was a little kid…
His mom and dad went out to a march, and one of the police chiefs was like, ‘Shoot to kill.’ So his mom and dad went to a protest dressed in white, and they came back dressed in red, because they had to drag themselves over dead bodies.
That was his first memory.
MAV: How do you think your father would like to be remembered?  
RCV: For me, papá, he was my best friend. But I think he would like to be remembered como un puertorriqueño de los pies a la cabeza. 
MAV: Uh huh.
RCV: As a true Puerto Rican from head to toe, and able to look at himself in the mirror every day and feel respect. 
I think that’s how he would love to be remembered.
