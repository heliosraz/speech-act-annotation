Lisa Harvard (LH) and Corey Harvard (CH)
 
LH: We had no idea, we really didn’t, so we were caught off guard, as you might say. 
 
CH: But, Mom, the amount of stuff I was looking at online when I got the computer, that was just me trying to learn about what it meant to be gay. if y’all were Snoopy parents, it would have taken no time to figure it out. 
 
LH: I remember in that very first conversation, I was looking directly across from you, and you fell into your dad’s arms. I know that I was numb in a lot of ways because a big part of it was feeling separated from you, and I didn’t like that. 
 
CH: Yeah, I remember feeling that distance. I think that with where all of us were, it was inevitable.
 
LH: And during those months and a couple years there, you would come back, we would have more conversations. Of course a lot of it we may not have understood, but it didn’t leave us just reeling, we talked about those things. As we were figuring out what this was going to look like for us. 
 
CH: Mm hmm. 
 
LH: Sometimes I just go into your room, even though we’ve remodeled, we made sure not to touch that room, and I sit on your bed, and I am really so hopeful that it was a good space because I wanted you to be a happy kid.
 
CH: The truth is, I felt so loved as a kid, but, I mean, there’s a part of that journey that no one can join you on.
 
A hard thing that I’ve always wanted to share with you, the beginning of my sophomore year, I was struggling the most. And it was this dark night of the soul where it’s like, can I really accept this? Have I failed at life? And there was that one night that got really hard, and I remember sitting on the windowsill and just contemplating it, like, what would it be like for this to all be over?
 
And this feeling that I had is you, and it’s like this invisible golden lasso. And I knew that even in this worst moment of my life, that I can’t fall. And the work that I do with these kids is how I took that golden lasso and I turned it into a net. And we just keep saving people with that love that you put in me. 
 
LH: Sometimes I look at you and I just can’t fathom the kind of love that I see you give it’s a humbling experience. You came into my life and changed me in so many ways, I’m so much better now than I ever would have been without you…and I’m so grateful to be your mom.
