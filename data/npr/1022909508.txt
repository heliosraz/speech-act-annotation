ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Insomniacs, gadget lovers, shopaholics and fans of dehydrated beef are all in mourning today.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The appliance that can slice, dice, chop...SHAPIRO: America has lost the infomercial star and inventor Ron Popeil.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON POPEIL: Just four easy payments. And it makes a great gift.AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Popeil, who was 86, died Wednesday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POPEIL: But wait. There's more.CHANG: He came direct into our living rooms to sell us gadgets we didn't even know we needed until we had to have them, like the Bagel Cutter, the Hav-a-Maid Mop and the Whip-O-Matic.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I got one.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I got this microphone, and I love it.SHAPIRO: Generations of TV viewers saw Popeil pitch his Pocket Fisherman.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: There's never been anything like it - Popeil's Pocket Fisherman.SHAPIRO: And hawk everything from the Veg-O-Matic to the Chop-O-Matic.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POPEIL: I'm going to show you the greatest kitchen appliance ever made. It's called Chop-O-Matic.CHANG: But wait. There's more. His biggest moneymaker was Ronco's Showtime Rotisserie and Barbecue. Popeil sold millions of the ovens and delivered his most memorable catchphrase.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POPEIL: Just...UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Set it and forget it.SHAPIRO: Set it and forget it.CHANG: (Laughter).SHAPIRO: Popeil and his gadgets were widely parodied, like in the song "Mr. Popeil" by Weird Al Yankovic.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MR.

For example, take this birthday tribute posted to Popeil's Facebook fan page last May.(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: (Singing) Your spray-on hair really worked, but some people thought it was a joke. Bought a Showtime Rotisserie. Works like a champ, it's true.
