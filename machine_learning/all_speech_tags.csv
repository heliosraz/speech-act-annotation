Annie Russell (AR): Time now for StoryCorps.,['Statement']
Joseph Rogers Britton has spent 40 years caring for others.,['Explain']
"In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV",['Explain']
 And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Explain']
You know what the biggest joy was? ,['Rhetorical']
"Finding a smile in that small, sick child. ",['Explain']
That just made my week.,['Explain']
During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Statement']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Explain']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work",['Statement']
Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV. ,['Explain']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Explain']
" We missed every single dinner date, every movie. ",['Explain']
And that led into a thirty year relationship,['Statement']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Explain']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses. ",['Explain']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Explain']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother. ",['Explain']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Explain']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Explain']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Response']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Explain']
And it’s not the glitz. ,['Explain']
It’s the simple touches.,['Explain']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence",['Explain']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV,['Open-ended Declaration']
You see everything as an opportunity because you’re here.,['Explain']
I can guarantee it,['Response']
"And, you really believe and you live – if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.",['Explain']
"Over the last year, Mary Johnson-Roy has been getting a steady stream of visitors… all there to basically say one thing…",['Explain']
"Thank you, Mary",['Explain']
 I love you.,['Statement']
I thank you so much just for being in my life,['Statement']
" I love you, sister Mary",['Statement']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy,['Statement']
 Mary lives in Minneapolis,['Explain']
And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide,['Explain']
"f it wasn’t for Mary, I don’t know where I would be as a grieving mother",['Explain']
"Well, I know that I wouldn’t be here. ",['Explain']
"Mary’s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.",['Explain']
But there’s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work…,['Explain']
Her connection to the man who killed her son…,['Explain']
My name is Mary Johnson. ,['Explain']
I am Oshea Israel,['Explain']
My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I’m her second son.,['Explain']
" From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps. ",['Explain']
I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Explain']
And I’m Michael Garofalo,['Explain']
This week… a story you have to hear to believe.,['Explain']
"Let’s start at the beginning… in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis…",['Explain']
"My son, Laramiun, was intelligent.",['Explain']
 Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level,['Explain']
" He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy.",['Explain']
"e grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.",['Explain']
Fast forward to 1993…when Laramiun was 20…,['Explain']
"He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that’s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.",['Explain']
"One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time",['Explain']
 They got into a fight… and Oshea shot and killed him,['Explain']
Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.,['Explain']
"And over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son",['Explain']
And after a decade of trying to find peace… she decided to try something different… to visit Oshea in prison.,['Explain']
" I’m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.",['Explain']
"That’s Regina Irwin, one of Mary’s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day",['Explain']
"As Mary was walking up to go to the prison, she stopped and she looked at me, and she said, “Regina, I can’t do it.”",['Explain']
And Mary was bending down almost like she was in labor.,['Explain']
"And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom",['Explain']
"And when she came out, she had prayed… and she was ready to go in. ",['Explain']
"As we were sitting at the table to meet Oshea, they had left a pitcher of water but they didn’t leave a glass for the man that had taken her son’s life",['Explain']
And Mary said “I will not sit here and not allow him to have a glass that he can drink water from just like everyone else here.”,['Explain']
And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink,['Explain']
We’ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next,['Explain']
This is from a conversation they had in 2011… shortly after Oshea finished serving his sentence,['Explain']
You and I met at Stillwater Prison,['Explain']
"I wanted to know if you were in the same mindset of what I remembered from court, where I wanted to go over and hurt you",['Explain']
 But you were not that 16-year-old. ,['Explain']
You were a grown man,['Explain']
 I shared with you about my son.,['Explain']
And he became human to me.,['Explain']
"You know, when I met you it was like, ok, this guy is real",['Explain']
"And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can– just hug you like I would my own mother, you know",['Explain']
" After you left the room, I began to say: ”I just hugged the man that murdered my son.”",['Explain']
"nd I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you– I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you. ",['Explain']
As far as receiving forgiveness from you– sometimes I still don’t know how to take it because I haven’t totally forgiven myself yet.,['Explain']
 It’s something that I’m learning from you – I won’t say that I have learned yet– because it’s still a process that I’m going through.,['Explain']
I treat you as I would treat my son,['Explain']
 And our relationship is beyond belief.,['Explain']
 We live next door to one another.,['Explain']
Yeah. So you can see what I’m doing– you know first hand. ,['Explain']
We actually bump into each other all the time leaving in and out of the house,['Explain']
Uh-huh…,['Response']
"And, you know, our conversations, they come from ”Boy, how come you ain’t called over here to check on me in a couple of days",['Explain']
You ain’t even asked me if I need my garbage to go out!”,['Explain']
Uh-huh.,['Response']
I find those things funny because it’s a relationship with a mother for real. ,['Explain']
"Well, my natural son is no longer here",['Explain']
I didn’t see him graduate,['Explain']
Now you’re going to college,['Explain']
I’ll have the opportunity to see you graduate,['Explain']
 I didn’t see him getting married,['Explain']
"Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to experience that with you",['Explain']
Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation,['Explain']
 It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.,['Explain']
You still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you– it’s amazing. ,['Explain']
"I know it’s not an easy thing, you know, to be able to share our story together.",['Explain']
"Even with us sitting here looking at each other right now, I know it’s not an easy thing",['Explain']
So I admire that you can do this.,['Explain']
"I love you, lady.",['Statement']
" I love you too, son.",['Statement']
After that interview aired on NPR… Mary and Oshea continued sharing their story far beyond Minneapolis.,['Explain']
"They hit the road… visiting churches, synagogues, and prisons…=",['Explain']
We were invited to a lot of different places.,['Explain']
"We’ve had a lot of moments, us walking through the airports together, trying to figure out where we’re going",['Explain']
"And as we share our story, we still get to hear each other’s parts which brings us even more closer",['Explain']
"And it seemed like the mission kind of took off, even to the point where it grew its own legs and started running.",['Explain']
They were on every national media outlet you can think of and international too.,['Explain']
She spoke at conferences around the world on love and forgiveness and met with world leaders.,['Explain']
 President Barack Obama even thanked her for her service.,['Explain']
That’s all because of how Mary has helped other families who have lost children to homicide. ,['Explain']
"She started an organization in 2005 called From Death to Life… that provides healing groups for mothers on both sides of a tragedy, and encourages forgiveness when mothers are ready.",['Explain']
: And through her work… she met the love of her life… a man named Ed Roy. ,['Explain']
"When my first-born and my one and only son was murdered, my daughters had asked me to go to the church to hear you speak.",['Explain']
"I wasn’t ready for the forgiveness part, but I was at a loss.",['Explain']
"Like I shared with you, I thought God took my boy and was punishing me for my own crimes",['Explain']
 I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old.,['Explain']
"But with you being there, I saw hope. ",['Explain']
You took me under your wing; that’s why I called you my angel.,['Explain']
"Then I remember, I had that dream — that was just before our wedding",['Explain']
"And your son was saying, ”Yeah, Mom! Alright!” You know, ”Right on!",['Explain']
"nd my son was saying, ”Yeah, Dad. ‘Bout time you got it right!”",['Explain']
"As the years and time goes by, you know where I’ve been",['Explain']
You know where I hurt.,['Explain']
And I know you take care of me when I’m not doing well.,['Explain']
The anniversary is coming up of my son’s murder and I’m grateful to have someone there that has experienced the same thing that I have.,['Explain']
That empty hole is always going to be there in our hearts.,['Explain']
"But I feel like when we together and we able to listen to one another’s heartbeats, it says a lot",['Explain']
I’m thankful; I really am.,['Explain']
You’re a good man.,['Explain']
They recorded that interview in 2017,['Explain']
"But recently, Ed has had to care for Mary in an entirely different way.",['Explain']
Stay with us…,['Explain']
 10 years after we first met Mary… she was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia… sometimes described as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s all rolled into one.,['Explain']
"And her husband, Ed, has been her main caretaker.",['Explain']
Just a few months ago… the two of them sat down for another interview.,['Explain']
There was a lot of things that neither one of us didn’t understand,['Explain']
"It was things like leaving something on the stove, parking your car a few houses down the street. ",['Explain']
"And as it progressed, we started understanding together what we was up against.",['Explain']
"Like, when you started seeing things — the invisible people.",['Explain']
"And we talked about it, honey",['Explain']
" You know, we made humor out of them",['Explain']
We call them the little people,['Explain']
Like when you had several bowls of cereal out and you was feeding them.,['Explain']
" And I said, “You giving all my Cap’n Crunch to the little people.",['Explain']
 What about me?”,['Explain']
"And you started laughing, you know.",['Explain']
We have so many moments.,['Explain']
"Yeah, I need to write them down. ",['Explain']
 They are written down,['Explain']
"They are written down in our hearts, honey.",['Explain']
Sometimes I think about when people say that a mind is a terrible thing to waste,['Explain']
…to waste. yeah.,['Explain']
But you know what?,['Explain']
The heart is the terrible thing to waste.,['Explain']
"You know, don’t think about just the memory things; we’re here to remember for each other",['Explain']
 Don’t worry about the reading because I’m here and read to you. ,['Explain']
How many men would do the things that you do as far as taking care of me? ,['Explain']
Like putting on my shoes today.,['Explain']
That’s what it’s all about.,['Explain']
Yeah.,['Response']
"You know, it’s about us taking care of one another. ",['Explain']
"ou’ve given me, Mary, a reason for living. ",['Explain']
"I always told you that, though.",['Explain']
Uh-huh.,['Response']
So that’s what I see you doing and giving to other people is hope,['Explain']
You have to have some kind of hope to hold on to,['Explain']
"When you don’t have that, you don’t have nothing. ",['Explain']
"So, it’s true",['Explain']
"It’s true what they say about when, uh, when they say wait on God, that he’ll send you that person",['Explain']
"You know, he knew what was in my heart.",['Explain']
 Wow. I love you.,['Statement']
I love you.,['Statement']
When word of Mary’s illness started to circulate among the families she’s helped… that’s when the visits we told you about earlier began…,['Explain']
You’ve got a full slate of visitors for today. ,['Explain']
Why are you saying somebody wants to come and sit and talk to me?,['Explain']
"Oh Mary, the world would be lined up if they were invited",['Explain']
That’s Brian Mogren,['Explain']
"One of Mary’s close friends and the Director of the St. Jane House, where Mary’s healing groups have been meeting for more than 15 years.",['Explain']
He started hosting “Thursdays with Mary” … so family and friends… including those Mary has helped… can now help her remember her impact.,['Explain']
 And at Mary’s request… Brian’s been recording these conversations.,['Explain']
" When I saw Brian’s note about meeting with you on Thursdays, I’m like, Oh, let me get my name on that list. Cause I want to see my friend.",['Explain']
Yeah. I’m so glad that you did,['Response']
 That’s Mary’s longtime friend Gwen Chandler.,['Explain']
"Baby, you will never have any idea how much you’ve influenced people’s lives",['Explain']
And people will be saying your name for generations and generations. ,['Explain']
" I met someone recently, her brother was murdered when she was younger, and she wants to meet the person who killed her brother",['Explain']
Michele Braley is a social worker who was also with Mary at the prison the day that Mary met Oshea,['Explain']
And they’ve been friends ever since…,['Explain']
"And she said, partly, she had the courage to do that because she knew of your story and that you met Oshea",['Explain']
She’s never met you but you gave her courage,['Explain']
"You know, we don’t know all the lives we impact, do we?",['Explain']
"You know, but I wanted to get a chance to tell you that, Mary.",['Explain']
And despite her illness…,['Explain']
Mary’s still been helping to run her healing group for mothers every other Saturday…,['Explain']
My name is Constance Styles and my son Dante Gray was murdered in 1994.,['Explain']
 Well I’m Ebony Robinson.,['Explain']
"My son’s name is Andre Riley Jr and I lost him July 3rd, 2016.",['Explain']
"My son was murdered in 2016, December 25th. ",['Explain']
My name is Angel Cradle.,['Explain']
The loss of my son Dewayne Tyson Sr. happened in 2007 and the loss of my grandson Dewayne Tyson Jr. happened in 2018,['Explain']
"My name is Ann and my son, Maurice Wilson, was killed October the sixth, 1997",['Explain']
" My name is Princess Titus and my son, Anthony Titus, was hit by a bullet intended for another child two weeks after his 16th birthday, right before the fireworks on July 4th, 2010",['Explain']
Some of the mothers who were there this particular day… turned the tables on Mary…,['Explain']
"Do you mind if we spend some time sharing with you, Mother Mary, what you mean to us?",['Explain']
Ok. Amen,['Response']
All right.,['Response']
Amen.,['Response']
I remember calling Mary around Mother’s Day.,['Explain']
" She said, this is just how it gets around Mother’s Day and holidays are gonna be like that.",['Explain']
So to have a woman who did walk that walk to let me know that I was not crazy and that we were not alone.,['Explain']
Loneliness doesn’t help grief and Mary did not allow us to be lonely. ,['Explain']
"So we’re forever grateful to you, Ms. Mary",['Explain']
"It’s not a happy situation, but we are blessed to be able to have you as our shepherd.",['Explain']
"Ooh, sister Mary, you mean the world to me.",['Explain']
I admire you so much,['Explain']
"o matter how hard things have been for you lately, you are still here teaching us and showing us what true love is. ",['Explain']
I think we all in tears around the table now,['Explain']
" So Mary, thank you for modeling… shining your little light everywhere you go.",['Explain']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Statement']
"Love you, ladies",['Statement']
We love you.,['Statement']
"Appreciate you so much, you don’t know.",['Statement']
But for all that’s happened over the past year… there was one person who hadn’t had this kind of conversation with Mary yet… Oshea,['Explain']
Her illness has affected him too,['Explain']
 It’s hard to see this woman who has meant so much to him declining.,['Explain']
"She’s not able to travel anymore or share their story together, which was such a big part of his life.",['Explain']
It gave him purpose,['Explain']
" So as much as she still means to him, he’s been hesitant to talk with her directly about her health.",['Explain']
"But finally, this summer, Oshea decided to sit down with Mary again… and StoryCorps was there to record it.",['Explain']
" Well Mary, it’s been 12 years since we sat down for our first StoryCorps interview and it’s more emotional for me this time",['Explain']
"You know, with everything that we’ve been through and we’ve dealt with and everything that’s going on now. ",['Explain']
"You know, it hurts to see",['Explain']
 I’m used to the lady that fusses at me all the time,['Explain']
But you’re strong and you’re going to fight for whatever you believe in,['Explain']
And I still see you fighting.,['Explain']
I’m glad to see you,['Explain']
I’m glad to see how you’re doing,['Explain']
So I thank God for that chance today.,['Explain']
A lot has changed.,['Explain']
"I, myself, have two children: my son, he’s three",['Explain']
And a little girl.,['Explain']
She’s how old now?,['Closed-ended']
She’s six years old now.,['Explain']
 I remember when she was born you helped me get the car seat for her,['Explain']
"ut since we were living next door to each other, you left me for another fella.",['Explain']
His name is Ed,['Explain']
I remember when I first got wind of you and Ed going out on dates.,['Explain']
"I’m like, wait, what’s going on?",['Explain']
You was mine.,['Explain']
"But you all blessed me with the opportunity to not only be present in the wedding but to walk you down the aisle, that was, like, again, your words: beyond belief. ",['Explain']
Yeah. I’m proud of you.,['Explain']
I’ve been proud for a while.  ,['Explain']
It has been an amazing journey,['Explain']
"From a hug to you becoming a grandmother through me with my kids, to you just being a beacon of light to a lot of people.",['Explain']
"On our last interview we ended it with me saying “I love you, lady.” ",['Explain']
Mary’s still living at home with Ed… and goes to a daytime memory care center three times a week.,['Explain']
Brian has set up a GoFundMe to help support them,['Explain']
But one thing is clear… even as Mary’s memory dims… her light does not.,['Explain']
" This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine, yeah.",['Explain']
This little light of mine…,['Explain']
"Yeah, I’m gonna let it shine.",['Explain']
"Let it shine, let it shine.",['Explain']
Let it shine,['Explain']
Everywhere I go,['Explain']
Everywhere I go… ,['Response']
I’m gonna let it shine… ,['Response']
 I’m gonna let it shine… ,['Response']
Yes…,['Response']
"Everywhere I go, I’m gonna let it shine. ",['Response']
Everywhere…,['Response']
Everywhere I go… ,['Response']
I’m gonna let it shine…,['Response']
Let it shine.,['Statement']
Let it shine,['Statement']
 Let it shine. ,['Statement']
"Yeah, Jesus gave it to me, yeah he did",['Response']
’m gonna let it shine.,['Statement']
"Yeah Jesus gave it to me, I’m gonna let it shine",['Statement']
"Jesus gave it to me, and I’m gonna let it shine",['Statement']
 Let it shine,['Statement']
Let it shine.,['Statement']
Let it shine.,['Statement']
This episode was produced by Jasmyn Morris and Jud Esty-Kendall,['Explain']
 Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd,['Explain']
Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer,['Explain']
"Special thanks to Ian Gonzalez, Gaspar Caro, Liyna Anwar, Roselyn Almonte and especially…Brian Mogren",['Explain']
Without him..none of these recordings would have been possible,['Explain']
"Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website",['Explain']
"There, you can learn more about recording your own interview",['Explain']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Explain']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. ,['Explain']
Join us again next week for our final episode… as we wrap up this special series…,['Explain']
"As always, thanks for listening.",['Explain']
" We’ve mentioned a lot of numbers over the past few episodes… 27,000 interviews on the mobile tour… 17,000 interviews in just one day when we released the app",['Explain']
But StoryCorps doesn’t just care about numbers… \n ,['Explain']
WHO records interviews is just as important as how many we collect,['Explain']
 If we’re building an archive of American voices… we need to make sure that the archive reflects who actually lives here in the United States,['Explain']
So while StoryCorps is open to anyone who wants to do an interview… we’ve worked to make sure that stories and voices that don’t often get included in the historical record ARE captured in the StoryCorps archive.,['Explain']
We call these efforts “initiatives”… you’ve heard about one already – StoryCorps Griot.,['Explain']
"There’s been quite a lot… like, Historias… or Military voices…",['Explain']
Our 9/11 initiative ,['Response']
We did one for people with Memory Loss…,['Response']
…and another inviting immigrants to record…,['Response']
But on this episode… we’re going to focus on just one of the many that we’ve done… our collection of LGBTQ voices… called StoryCorps OutLoud… ,['Response']
To be in the service for my country is the greatest thing I thought I did but I was kicked out for being homosexual.,['Explain']
When I first came out they didn’t have the words that they have today.,['Explain']
"So, attempting to tell your extraordinarily loving blue-collar parents that you were transgender was tantamount to telling them I was from Jupiter.",['Explain']
"We got married at the veterans home and we said, ’If you came to see the bride, you’re out of luck!’",['Response']
Do you remember that?,['Closed-ended']
"Yes, of course!",['Response']
 I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Explain']
nd I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Explain']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.\n ,['Explain']
"So we thought if we’re telling the story of StoryCorps this season, recording and sharing stories from LGTBQ folks has always been a part of that work and so why is that built into your fabric as a documentary radio producer and the founder of StoryCorps?",['Explain']
"It’s always been an issue that’s, you know, close to my heart.",['Explain']
 I’m the proud son of a gay dad. ,['Explain']
That’s Dave Isay… Jasmyn recently sat down with him to talk about the origins of OutLoud.,['Explain']
"My dad was named Richard Isay, and he was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst",['Explain']
"For many years, he saw only gay patients and was kind of a revolutionary in the psychoanalytic world in saying that homosexuality was not a disease and advocating in the work he did for helping LGBTQ folks find love",['Explain']
 So that was his mission in life.,['Explain']
I accidentally discovered he was gay when I was 21 and our nuclear family exploded,['Explain']
"Despite, you know, many hints and clues, I was taken completely by surprise.",['Explain']
" And I was really unhappy about a lot of things, uh, and confused about a lot of things.",['Explain']
And I withdrew from my dad for a while and it was about that time that I started making radio documentaries.  ,['Explain']
"At some point after my dad came out, he did tell me the story of the Stonewall riots, which I knew nothing about. ",['Explain']
And it was just a year or two later that I made my first radio documentary and I decided to make it on Stonewall.,['Explain']
" It was the first oral history of people who had been at Stonewall, believe it or not.",['Explain']
"I remember on that night, when we saw the riot police, all of us drag queens, we linked arms like the Rockettes and sang the song we used to sing.",['Explain']
 “We are the village girls. ,['Explain']
We wear our hair in curls. ,['Explain']
We wear our dungarees above our nelly-knees” and the police went crazy hearing that and they just immediately rushed us.,['Explain']
 We gave one kick and fled.,['Explain']
 A lot of these folks had never been interviewed before about what had happened on that day.,['Explain']
 And I was very interested in what life was like before Stonewall.,['Explain']
"Sylvia Rivera, who’s kind of known as the Rosa Parks of the Stonewall movement, became one of my best friends and was the centerpiece of this radio documentary, which was named Remembering Stonewall, and I dedicated it to my dad.",['Explain']
 The era before Stonewall was a hard era. ,['Response']
"There was always the gay bashings on the drag queens by heterosexual men, women, and the police",['Explain']
" We learned to live with it because it was part of the lifestyle at that time, I guess, but none of us were very happy about it.",['Explain']
" In some ways, was that you trying to figure out this time in your life where there was a secret, like, life before your dad coming out?",['Open-ended']
Yeah. I was very interested to understand what he had gone through,['Response']
" And, you know, once he came out, I had found out things like, you know, he had been entrapped in a restroom, and he had to beg the cops not to put his name in the paper and, you know, destroy his life.",['Explain']
"And he had been a rising star in the world of psychoanalysts, and that star was completely extinguished the minute he came out.",['Explain']
"He was shunned and, you know, refused positions and he was very moved by the fact that I had made this documentary. ",['Explain']
"And, you know, it was me making an effort to understand him",['Explain']
"And, um, that was the beginning of our rebuilding our relationship with each other.",['Explain']
"Many, many, many years after that, I started StoryCorps",['Explain']
 And I guess you could say that there was something about not being crazy about secrets in our lives that was part of the motivation behind starting StoryCorps – giving people the chance to say the important things to the people who are most important to us,['Explain']
And that included Dave,['Explain']
Here he is talking with his dad in 2004….,['Explain']
What truly was the happiest moment of your life? ,['Open-ended']
I think I am happier now than I’ve ever been in my life,['Response']
"So it’s, um, happiness is a continuing process. ",['Explain']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Open-ended']
Where am I going?,['Open-ended']
 I don’t think much about that. ,['Response']
You think about dying? ,['Closed-ended']
 All the time. ,['Response']
 Are you scared of dying? ,['Closed-ended']
"No, I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore.",['Response']
" It’s, uh, it’s more an absence of that. ",['Explain']
What do you think is the most important thing that you’ve accomplished in your life?,['Open-ended']
 What are you proudest of? ,['Open-ended']
Very proud of you kids.,['Response']
I am very proud of the work I’ve done and I am proud of being able to turn my life around and make it into a happy and good one.,['Response']
Were you unhappy when I was a kid? ,['Closed-ended']
"No, I think I was happy when you were a kid",['Response']
And I was a good father and I loved having kids,['Explain']
You think I was a good father? ,['Closed-ended']
 I think you were a good father. ,['Response']
You’re still a good father.,['Statement']
My dad got sick in 2012 on a Friday,['Explain']
 He was diagnosed with cancer and he died the next week,['Explain']
"And he actually died on the anniversary of Stonewall on June 28th, 2012.",['Explain']
"At the memorial service, I announced that in honor of my dad, we would be recording stories of people who were alive before Stonewall and that’s where it all began.",['Explain']
" And then, you know how I am— ",['Explain']
Yeah,['Response']
"I’m like a dog with a piece of steak, you know?",['Rhetorical']
"After my dad died, there was no way that this thing wasn’t gonna get done, if it killed me",['Explain']
"And you know, that’s the way I, I guess, that I deal with, you know, grief or, or any issues, is that I just stay focused on StoryCorps and get something new done.",['Explain']
"I decided, you know, come hell or high water, we were going to do this program, which we named OutLoud. ",['Explain']
It launched in June 2014…,['Explain']
LGTBQ people from all walks of life came in to tell stories of love… loss… resiliency and creativity… and… family. ,['Explain']
 So in keeping with Dave’s story… we’re spending this episode hearing conversations about family… ,['Explain']
This first one is set in a small farming town in Washington State… where Patrick Haggerty was growing up in the 1950s,['Explain']
"At StoryCorps he told his daughter, Robin, about something that happened in high school. ",['Explain']
There was an assembly that day and Patrick was going to perform. \n ,['Explain']
"I’m riding to school with my oldest brother, and on the way to school, I’m putting glitter all over my face",['Explain']
"And my brother said, ”What in the hell are you doing?”",['Explain']
"And I said, ”I’m putting on my costume.”",['Explain']
" And he said, ”Well, I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing that.” ",['Explain']
"So he dropped me off at the school, and he called my dad up, and he said, ”Dad, I think you better get up there.",['Explain']
 This is not going to look good.” ,['Explain']
So my dad drove up to the high school,['Explain']
". And he had his farmer jeans on and they had cow crap on them, and he had his clodhopper boots on.",['Explain']
" And when I saw him coming, I ducked around the hall and hid from him.",['Explain']
"And it wasn’t because of what I was wearing, it was because of what he was wearing.  \n ",['Explain']
"So, the assembly goes well, and I climb in the car and I’m riding home with my father. ",['Explain']
"My father says to me, ”I was walking down the hall this morning, and I saw a kid that looked a lot like you ducking around the hall to avoid his dad.",['Explain']
"But I know it wasn’t you, cause you would never do that to your dad.”",['Explain']
" And I squirmed in my seat, and I finally busted out and I said, ”Well dad, did you have to wear your cow-crap jeans to my assembly?”",['Explain']
"And he said, ”Look, everybody knows I’m a dairy farmer. ",['Explain']
This is who I am.”,['Explain']
And he looked me square in the eye,['Explain']
"And then he said, ”Now, how bout you?",['Explain']
"When you’re a full-grown man, who are you gonna go out with at night?",['Explain']
" And I said, ”I don’t know.” ",['Explain']
"And he said, ”I think you do know, and it’s not gonna be that McGlaughlin girl that’s been making goo-goo eyes at you but you won’t even pick up the damn telephone.”",['Explain']
"“Now, I’m gonna tell you something today, and you might not know what to think of it now, but you’re gonna remember when you’re an adult. ",['Explain']
Don’t sneak.,['Explain']
" Because if you sneak, like you did today, it means you think you’re doing the wrong thing",['Explain']
"And if you run around spending your whole life thinking that you’re doing the wrong thing, then you’ll ruin your immortal soul.",['Explain']
"And out of all the things a father in 1959 could have told his gay son, my father tells me to be proud of myself and not sneak. ",['Explain']
My reaction at the time was to get out in the hay field and pretend like I was as much of a man as I could be,['Explain']
"And I remember flipping 50-pound bales three feet up into the air going, ”I’m not a queer",['Explain']
 What’s he talking about?”,['Rhetorical']
But he knew where I was headed.,['Response']
And he…he knew that making me feel bad about it in any way was the wrong thing to do,['Explain']
" I had the patron saint of dads for sissies, and no, I didn’t know at the time, but I know it now",['Explain']
"Patrick Haggerty remembering his father, Charles Edward Haggerty",['Explain']
 Patrick was the founder of Lavender Country – which he called the world’s first openly gay country band,['Explain']
He died in 2022.,['Explain']
How have you seen things change in the way that we talk about and the way we tell stories from the LGBTQ community?,['Explain']
" I remember when I did the Stonewall documentary, I was trying to get newspapers to cover it, and I called the major newspaper in New York and said, you know, “we have this documentary, the first oral history of Stonewall, would you like to do a story about it?”",['Explain']
" And they said, “we don’t do stories about those kinds of people.”",['Explain']
"I like to think that at StoryCorps, we just, you know, whisper truths in people’s ears.",['Explain']
And what we try and do is find stories that haven’t been told before that creep up behind you and help you see yourself and someone who you might have thought was very different than you,['Explain']
 And I think we’ve done that from the first days of StoryCorps,['Explain']
" So I think, you know, nothing’s changed.",['Explain']
" We just, do our best to, you know, help be the vehicle through which people can have their stories told to the world.",['Explain']
More of those stories coming… after the break.,['Explain']
Stay with us…,['Explain']
Welcome back – we’re listening to conversations from StoryCorps OutLoud… our initiative to collect and preserve the stories of LGBTQ people across the country.,['Explain']
M.J. Seide fell in love in the early 1990s,['Explain']
Her partner had already been married and raised children… even grandchildren…,['Explain']
"Which meant that M.J. suddenly became a grandma, too…",['Explain']
"Here she is with her 12-year-old granddaughter, Genna Alperin.",['Explain']
How has your life been different than what you thought it was gonna to be?,['Open-ended']
I thought that my life was probably not one that was gonna be worth living.,['Response']
"There was this hole that I had all of my life because, I never thought I’d be able to walk along the beach and hold somebody’s hand because I’m gay",['Explain']
"But, you know, when I fell in love with Mamommy, I knew that she was my soulmate. ",['Explain']
Do you know what I mean by that?,['Closed-ended']
Yeah.,['Response']
 I’d never felt that way about anyone before.,['Explain']
" And um, after she had gotten her divorce from grandpa Jim, she was very upfront with your mom",['Explain']
" She told your mom that she was in love, and it was with a woman",['Explain']
 And that was the first time that anyone was proud to say that they loved me,['Explain']
 That made me the happiest I’d ever been in my life. ,['Explain']
"And then, when I got to know your mom and uncle Justin, I knew that I had hit paradise because I now have a family that I can wrap my arms around",['Explain']
Is there anything that you’ve never told me that you wanna tell me now?,['Explain']
"You know, you and I talk about most things but this is the first time that we’ve ever talked about the fact that I’m gay and I guess what I wanna ask you is, does it embarrass you to have a gay grandma?",['Explain']
No,['Response']
: No?,['Clarification']
It doesn’t really matter,['Response']
 It doesn’t.,['Response']
It just matters my relationship with you.,['Response']
" I always tell you how much I love you, but I don’t know that you can really understand the depth of it, because you’re someone that I never thought would be in my life and I can’t imagine my life without you.",['Response']
"You have always been a child that makes up her own mind and, I always knew that you were going to grow up to be a woman that we would all be very, very proud of.",['Explain']
"Well, um",['Response']
You’re one of my favorite grandmas,['Response']
"You do, like, a lot of things with me like ride roller coasters and (GA & MS laugh) play poker (GA & MS laugh) I don’t know what life would be like without you here.",['Explain']
 I love you sweetheart.,['Response']
Love you too.,['Response']
OutLoud was started to preserve the stories of the pre-Stonewall generation while we still could… but as it’s continued… it’s also documented several other generations… including the youngest one…,['Explain']
"Gabe Lopez always knew he was a boy, even though his birth certificate said otherwise.",['Explain']
"When he was 8 years old, Gabe came to StoryCorps in Arizona, where he lives, with his mom Chris, and they talked about how a weekend at camp for transgender kids transformed his life.",['Explain']
 Do you remember when things really changed for you? ,['Closed-ended']
 We went to a camp,['Response']
"And I met three best friends — Luke, Brock, and Cooper.",['Explain']
"They were all transgender like me, so they all wanted to be boys.",['Explain']
"And that was huge for you, right?",['Closed-ended']
Yeah.,['Response']
That’s why I say we’re bros.,['Explain']
We know each other.,['Explain']
Do you ever get scared about what it’s going to be like to grow up transgender?,['Closed-ended']
"I’ve been wondering if when I’m older, a lot of people will try to hurt me or something … or … ",['Explain']
Like if they find out you were born a girl and they have a problem with it? ,['Closed-ended']
Mhmm,['Clarification']
You think they might try to hurt you in some way? ,['Closed-ended']
Yeah,['Response']
Were you ever worried about telling me that you were transgender? ,['Closed-ended']
Yes,['Explain']
Did you ever try to tell me and then change your mind? ,['Open-ended']
Mmhmm,['Response']
How many times do you think? ,['Open-ended']
"I think like, four times. ",['Response']
Four times? ,['Clarification']
I was worried that you liked me as a girl. ,['Response']
Because we used to have a lot of fun? ,['Clarification']
Mmhmm. ,['Response']
Do we still have fun? ,['Closed-ended']
"So it doesn’t really matter if you’re a boy or a girl, right? ",['Clarification']
Mhhmm,['Response']
Yeah,['Response']
I didn’t know that you were dealing with that on your own.,['Response']
"If I’d known I would have tried a little bit harder to have that conversation with you, and maybe start it myself. ",['Explain']
" Um, do you worry about me? ",['Closed-ended']
I worry about how other people might treat you.,['Response']
 And it makes me upset to think about what you might have to go through. \n ,['Explain']
You amaze me every day,['Explain']
"And you can tell me anything, anytime, anywhere, and it won’t change how much I love you",['Explain']
I’ll always have your back. ,['Explain']
" Thank you, mom.",['Response']
 That conversation was recorded on our mobile tour in 2015… ,['Explain']
"And just this year Gabe, who’s now 16 years old… came back for another conversation",['Explain']
" This time with his dad, Julio.",['Explain']
Did you ever feel jealous that it was my friends who taught me how to pee standing up? ,['Closed-ended']
"No, I don’t think so.",['Response']
"But I was like, “that takes some talent to be able to do that.”",['Explain']
"When I first talked to you guys about how I felt, I was young, obviously, but I didn’t know the consequences that people could have for coming out to their parents",['Explain']
"We always thought it was just kind of a phase and we told you that, right? ",['Clarification']
: Mm-hmm. ,['Response']
And I remember saying that to you because it happened with my sister.,['Response']
"You know, my sister was very tomboyish and hanging out with the boys but I noticed something different in you. ",['Response']
"So when you came out to us, it caught us by surprise, but it wasn’t a big surprise.",['Response']
You know what I mean?,['Clarification']
Yeah,['Response']
" I was really happy that you guys were super supportive, because I know that not many kids get that.   ",['Explain']
"We’ve always loved you, no matter what. ",['Response']
"Like one of the pictures that I cherish, you were in a dress, you were holding a, a toy gun mm-hmm",['Explain']
 And your Hulk shoes…,['Explain']
"… and I mean, you know,  even though that time was still kind of difficult for you.",['Explain']
I saw who Gabe was and who he was gonna become in the future. ,['Explain']
I’m always gonna be able to cherish that. ,['Explain']
How would you describe yourself today?,['Open-ended']
"I’m really trying to up my art game, so I can be a tattoo artist",['Explain']
I bought you a tattoo gun.,['Explain']
"And then told you I can be your test dummy and I love it because, for your first tattoo on a person, that came out really good",['Explain']
What kind of man do you want to be?,['Open-ended']
The kind of man that can help others see different viewpoints,['Explain']
And not specifically that they have to agree with that side but they acknowledge that it’s there,['Explain']
What are your hopes for me?,['Open-ended']
I want you to be happy,['Explain']
When I leave here I want you to be OK,['Explain']
That’s all I’m wanting for you.,['Explain']
 I don’t think we have any idea what these stories…what this kind of collection of the wisdom of humanity is going to mean a hundred years from now,['Explain']
But it’s a way to pass wisdom from one generation to the next and it shows the best in us,['Explain']
"And that’s one of those, you know, those lessons of StoryCorps; just reminds us of the fundamental goodness of humanity. ",['Explain']
"And we have to trust in that, especially, when we go through rough times, like we’re going through today",['Explain']
"But you know, that’s a lesson going back to Stonewall and Sylvia Rivera and, you know, the heroes who fought on that night, that you just can’t give up.",['Explain']
And I do believe that good wins in the end. ,['Explain']

Thanks for listening.,['Explain']
I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started.,['Open-ended Declaration']
And they would see me again around Christmas time,['Statement']
And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again.,['Statement']
"So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable.",['Explain']
And as far as you doing the business?,['Rhetorical']
You started younger than me.,['Response']
As soon as I could walk.,['Explain']
Even before you were walking.,['Explain']
"Yeah, I…",['Response']
 I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.,['Response']
I was literally there since day one.,['Explain']
"I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.”",['Explain']
"Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. ",['Explain']
"One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.",['Explain']
I have a sense of usefulness.,['Response']
"And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.",['Explain']
"I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…",['Response']
That comes from coming from immigrant parents. ,['Explain']
You can never work hard enough.,['Explain']
"Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.”",['Statement']
" Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Rhetorical']
Never.,['Response']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Rhetorical']
"No, never.",['Response']
And when am I gonna retire?,['Rhetorical']
One day before your funeral? ,['Rhetorical']
You know it.,['Response']
"You know if you ever didn’t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken. ",['Explain']
I would understand.,['Response']
" Yeah, yeah.",['Response']
You know what I mean?,['Clarification']
"My father, he hated my business man.",['Statement']
" You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time.",['Explain']
I like that.,['Explain']
"But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.”",['Statement']
"You raised all of us, man.",['Response']
"Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man.",['Explain']
That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.,['Explain']
Well you do your best kid.,['Response']
This is what you do. ,['Explain']
But honestly your best.,['Explain']
Not just your B.S. best. ,['Explain']
And even if you fail.,['Explain']
 It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Explain']
You’re always my barometer.,['Response']
You never let anyone down.,['Explain']
That’s what sets you apart.,['Statement']
My name is Rob Rigano. ,['Explain']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Open-ended']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately",['Response']
Yes,['Statement']
 Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego.,['Explain']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Explain']
He came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.,['Explain']
"My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.  ",['Explain']
"What’s your earliest memory, Rob? ",['Open-ended']
I rolled my Uncle Charlie’s Dodge into the street light.,['Response']
"Wait, what happened?-",['Open-ended']
"Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Explain']
 Into a telephone pole? ,['Closed-ended']
 Yes.,['Response']
Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled.,['Explain']
"He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.  ",['Explain']
"Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,",['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, I fell out.",['Response']
Yeah?,['Confirmation']
"And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving? ",['Open-ended']
"No, the locks were defected.",['Explain']
So you weren’t playing with the door handle? ,['Clarification']
No.,['Response']
 I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.,['Explain']
I know you had trouble with the locks,['Explain']
And then another time I bit a horse. ,['Response']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Response']
I thought I did?,['Confirmation']
"The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.”",['Response']
Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years.,['Explain']
"Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping.",['Explain']
And he got to know nearly every resident. ,['Explain']
He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people.,['Explain']
In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors. ,['Explain']
"And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?”",['Explain']
He just has that sense of what’s right,['Explain']
What’s your happiest memory? ,['Open-ended']
"Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim.",['Response']
But my dad’s a little excitable. ,['Explain']
"Why do you think that is, Rob? ",['Open-ended']
 I think that’s his nature. ,['Explain']
Yeah? ,['Confirmation']
"Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things? ",['Clarification']
"No no, that’s his nature. ",['Response']
Rolling cars into trees?,['Closed-ended']
I don’t do that anymore. ,['Explain']
Oh okay,['Response']
"I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?” ",['Explain']
"Because he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor.",['Explain']
He is not as effervescent as he used to be. ,['Explain']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together. ,['Explain']
He is a gem of a guy and we all helped polish him.,['Explain']
Anything else Rob?,['Open-ended']
I think that’s about it. ,['Response']
 That’s all? ,['Confirmation']
Yeah. ,['Response']
And next year we could have stories about you.,['Explain']
For 25 years… the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay… ,['Explain']
And if you called in the 1980s… longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone. ,['Explain']
At StoryCorps… she remembered what this work meant to her.,['Explain']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building.,['Explain']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. ",['Explain']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.",['Explain']
" It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy. ",['Explain']
But it was our place.,['Statement']
"You know, it was beautiful. ",['Statement']
"Typical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically?",['Explain']
"But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk… Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something.",['Explain']
‘Should I tell my parents? Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’ ,['Explain']
"The suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that",['Explain']
I had a few of those calls.,['Explain']
"‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’",['Explain']
"That’s all we could say, really.",['Explain']
"But I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.",['Explain']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Explain']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14",['Explain']
" And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him",['Explain']
And my mother,['Rhetorical']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Explain']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters. ,['Explain']
"So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore",['Explain']
" You know, and I was still like just a kid.",['Explain']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted",['Explain']
But that wasn’t who I was. ,['Explain']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Explain']
That’s what people wanted to hear. ,['Explain']
"You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone. ",['Explain']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Explain']
"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you.",['Explain']
And you bent over and kissed me on the head,['Explain']
"It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.",['Explain']
And I felt that things really would be OK.,['Explain']
"When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died",['Explain']
 And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person,['Explain']
"Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’",['Explain']
And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill. ,['Response']
"And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.",['Explain']
"Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter.",['Response']
I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards,['Open-ended Declaration']
"Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.",['Response']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019,['Explain']
"After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.",['Explain']
My relationship with you is very important to me. ,['Explain']
"Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved. ",['Explain']
"And when I met you, it made me feel so much better. ",['Explain']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Open-ended']
"To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another… And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.",['Explain']
It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had. ,['Explain']
It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.,['Explain']
"We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends.",['Explain']
And we had that book at her funeral service.,['Explain']
"So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief…",['Explain']
Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us.,['Explain']
And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind.,['Explain']
"I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.",['Explain']
And that was in a big way John.,['Response']
I almost feel like you’re a brother.,['Explain']
I suspect our mothers have something to do with that.,['Response']
They might quite well,['Response']
"Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think",['Explain']
 So what a gift they gave us.,['Statement']
They certainly did.,['Response']
This one is from 2004…,['Explain']
"We’re trying to create an oral history of America from the bottom up and that’s what we’re getting, everyday people, just regular people talking in the booth and it’s been incredibly gratifying.",['Explain']
"And so I know you’re a big-think kind of guy, what’s the larger impact that you hope this will have on America if your vision really succeeds in getting a lot of people around America doing this?",['Open-ended']
 It’s a project about getting people to listen to each other.,['Explain']
" I mean, we live in such a culture of, you know, even when you look at the best seller list, you’ve got these books that are all the way on the right and all the way on the left",['Explain']
 And it just seems like everybody is screaming at each other.,['Explain']
There’s just this lack of real honest communication and it’s simply about getting people to sit down and talk to each other and listen.,['Explain']
So now you’re going to get diehard Democrats and diehard Republicans to the booth to really listen to each other about where their views come from?,['Open-ended']
"Hey, you never know",['Response']
You never know. ,['Response']
 We hope so.,['Explain']
20 years ago… that sounded like a whimsical idea… ,['Explain']
But that comment would end up being kind of prophetic,['Explain']
"In the years since that interview, the divides in this country have grown wider… and the stakes have gotten much, much higher.",['Explain']
Listen to this StoryCorps participant named John Klinkel… he’s a veteran and he did multiple tours in Afghanistan… ,['Explain']
I was out of the country from 2009 until about March of 2017,['Explain']
". When I got back, the country was almost as angry as some of the factions I remember seeing in Afghanistan.",['Explain']
" It felt like a country that was always on the verge of either tearing itself, apart or picking a fight.",['Explain']
 And I didn’t remember that from when I left.,['Explain']
 So it was very strange for me to come back and feel the anger.,['Explain']
"If you think of being in a deployed environment, you want to stay in the yellow light, cautious, ready to go but recognizing that things haven’t jumped off just yet.",['Explain']
And it kind of felt like that,['Explain']
"It felt like, Ooh, we’re in a situation here",['Explain']
Who knows what’s going to happen.,['Explain']
Whenever there’s a national crisis or tragedy of some sort… StoryCorps has always tried to find ways to be helpful.,['Explain']
"When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks",['Explain']
 We offered families who had lost someone that day the opportunity to record their memories… to make sure their loved ones wouldn’t be forgotten.,['Explain']
 In earlier episodes you heard about how we brought a Mobile Booth to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina…,['Explain']
And how we built new technology to help connect people during Covid.,['Explain']
And so in this final episode we’ll learn what StoryCorps is doing NOW… ,['Explain']
And where we might go in the future… I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Explain']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Explain']
"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now – celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Explain']
hat clip youjust  heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US… that’s from an initiative called One Small Step,['Explain']
Our effort to address just how divided we’ve become.,['Explain']
 It brings strangers with opposing political beliefs together for a conversation – not to argue about politics… but just to learn about each other’s lives.,['Explain']
We don’t expect them to or even want them or ask them to agree by the end of the conversation. ,['Explain']
That’s Mary Bess Ser…. she works on One Small Step. ,['Explain']
 We’re not asking people to come to any sort of common ground,['Explain']
We just want people to talk. ,['Explain']
Because… we HAVE stopped talking to each other,['Explain']
. A lot of us have a tendency to shut out people we don’t agree with… so One Small Step asks us to do the opposite… to actually get to know each other. ,['Explain']
"The basis of the whole conversation is, you know, yes, we probably disagree on most things, but we’re having this conversation anyway.",['Explain']
"And by the end of it, We’ll see what happens.  ",['Explain']
"You know, these days the voices telling us that we’re supposed to hate each other are so loud… and so pervasive… One Small Step really feels like David taking on Goliath… but we’ve never shied from a challenge before…",['Explain']
And there’s scientific evidence that something like this can make a difference,['Explain']
 One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.,['Explain']
The idea is that under very specific circumstances… when people who consider themselves enemies are put together one on one… they can actually come out the other side of that experience understanding and accepting each other… and sometimes they even become friends. ,['Explain']
One of the keys is that phrase “very specific circumstances” – so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.,['Explain']
Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other… but One Small Step interviews are between strangers.,['Explain']
Here’s Mary Bess again…,['Explain']
The fact that they’re strangers really makes it less threatening.,['Explain']
 So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother – that may or may not be my story –  it’s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there’s no relationship at stake,['Explain']
You come to the table with a clean slate.  ,['Explain']
Here’s how it works – people sign up online – there’s a questionnaire that asks them to rate how they feel about social and economic issues… how important religion is in their lives…,['Explain']
"hey can select from a list of terms to identify themselves… things like parent, grandparent or veteran.",['Explain']
And they write a short bio… describing themselves in their own words – and that gets shared with their interview partner. ,['Explain']
 Then someone from StoryCorps – like Mary Bess – matches them up with a stranger. ,['Explain']
There’s a real person doing the pairing… not an algorithm.,['Explain']
 They don’t see the reason why we’ve matched them,['Explain']
" Really they show up to the interview, you know, not knowing at all what to expect, and usually people realize that they’ve come to the table with a lot of assumptions. ",['Explain']
 Here’s one example,['Explain']
" It comes from Birmingham, Alabama… where Cassandra Adams, a liberal, was paired with David Wilson, a conservative. ",['Explain']
" Lemme ask you this, when you read my bio…",['Explain']
 Mm-hmm.,['Response']
What did you think?,['Open-ended']
And please be as honest as you feel comfortable because nothing would bother me.,['Request']
"Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype— ",['Explain']
 Mm-hmm.,['Response']
"Second part was intriguing because you said something along the lines of an open mind and I thought, well this would be interesting.",['Explain']
When I read your bio I just thought you were a white man.,['Response']
 I thought I was gonna come in here and just be like… ,['Explain']
I don’t even know what it was! I don’t remember what it was!,['Explain']
And that’s what’s so interesting to me!,['Response']
 Is that I’m just like… ,['Explain']
Stereotype!,['Response']
That’s exactly right!,['Response']
"So I have to admit it because when you walked in the door and I stood up and introduce myself I was like ‘oops, oops, oops.’",['Explain']
"To have this opportunity to match people, like they’re dating, and there’s always some sort of coincidence that we didn’t even know about",['Explain']
"One interview, we found out that both participants, I mean, they couldn’t be more different, but they’re both foster parents, and we didn’t know that. ",['Explain']
"That wasn’t even a point of connection where I thought, oh, they’re so different, but they’re foster parents.",['Explain']
This will be a great conversation.,['Explain']
Nope. I didn’t even know.,['Explain']
 They had a great time,['Explain']
They wanted to go out for coffee afterwards.,['Explain']
": Yeah. I mean, that really is something, right?",['Explain']
"Because we’re told constantly, talking about the other side, like, oh, those people, we can’t possibly have anything in common with them, and then it’s amazing to hear that there’s almost always something.",['Explain']
"Yeah, and it can be something completely uninteresting too it could be like, Oh, both of these people are into intermittent fasting, you know, like, (laughs) but they have something to talk about, you know, that, (laughs) and they realize that it’s the shared humanity aspect of it, you know",['Explain']
"Here’s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona. ",['Explain']
Their connection… was parenting,['Explain']
 I’ve been stretched and challenged far beyond I knew was possible,['Explain']
You know?,['Rhetorical']
" And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one?",['Open-ended']
 Right?,['Confirmation']
And your heart just seems to have all kinds of elastic in it.,['Explain']
 It doesn’t ever wear out.,['Explain']
 Right?,['Confirmation']
 You know?,['Open-ended']
Pretty amazing.,['Explain']
Yeah,['Response']
So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?,['Open-ended']
That’s a great question,['Response']
" My dad would say, “Well you can do that if you want",['Explain']
 I prefer this.”,['Explain']
 And he let us see that opportunity for ourselves.,['Explain']
I remember when I told him I wanted to try smoking cigarettes.,['Explain']
" And he said, “Well, I personally prefer to breathe clean air, but if that’s your choice, then you go for it” and took the excitement out of it.",['Explain']
"But, you actually told him that.",['Response']
Yeah. Yeah.,['Response']
That you had that relationship you could do that.,['Response']
Yes,['Response']
 I feel like I lean toward that with my children,['Explain']
You know I think what a gift your father gave you,['Response']
So I’m very much a daddy’s girl,['Explain']
I connected with him,['Explain']
 He was my junior senior high school principal,['Explain']
So 7th through 12th grade,['Explain']
" And when I was going into 7th grade, you know, he made sure he had a conversation with me where he said, “You know, your mom and I think you’re pretty special but, because you’re my daughter, you’re probably going to have few friends and you probably won’t have anybody who will want to date you",['Explain']
"And it’s not because you don’t have a lot to offer, but it’s primarily because of whose daughter you are.”",['Explain']
"The fact that he did that, laid that out for a 12-year-old girl, he set the tone for me to know what the road was going to be like. ",['Explain']
"And we didn’t have a lot of conversations, you know?",['Rhetorical']
" And I don’t know how often my father ever said I love you, but I know he loved me.",['Explain']
Who knew how that was going to go? ,['Explain']
"Like you said, it’s unscripted",['Explain']
" We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right?",['Open-ended']
 Like that.,['Explain']
 Let me give you a hug.,['Offer']
" A lot of people think that, Oh, one small step, these conversations, people are going to attack each other, you know, it’s going to get ugly",['Explain']
"And honestly, it’s the opposite. ",['Explain']
"Some people don’t want to participate because they say, well, I don’t really know, I’m not really well versed in what’s going on in politics right now.",['Explain']
"That’s where we say, you know, you don’t have to prepare for this experience.",['Explain']
"You don’t have to, this isn’t a debate. ",['Explain']
"You don’t need to bring a briefcase full of, you know, the most recent articles. you just bring your life experience and talk about what you care about, what your life has been like and listen to someone else do the same and that’s pretty much it.",['Explain']
So there ARE some other ways One Small Step interviews are different from standard StoryCorps conversations…,['Explain']
Each One Small Step interview starts with the participants reading each other’s bios out loud… ,['Explain']
And then a trained facilitator guides them through the conversation with questions from a list designed specifically for One Small Step. ,['Explain']
"One of the questions is can you describe in your own words, your personal political values?",['Open-ended']
"The way it’s phrased you’re asked to talk about why you care about something, why it’s important to you, why you believe X, Y, or Z",['Explain']
So you’re still talking about your own life.,['Explain']
"You’re still telling stories, you know, how your grandfather influenced you, or, you know, you grew up poor.",['Explain']
It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right? ,['Open-ended']
Right.,['Response']
"And makes it about understanding, which is, like, a completely different approach ",['Explain']
" Yeah, I mean you can still walk out of the room and think, you know, that person everything they stand for is completely wrong, but, somehow, I enjoyed speaking with them, or somehow I kind of respect them. ",['Response']
"This next conversation comes from Columbus, Georgia… Alton Russell is the former Chair of the Republican party there…",['Explain']
And he was paired with Wane Hailes… who was the President of the local chapter of the NAACP.,['Explain']
These guys knew of each other… but they had never spoken before this interview.,['Explain']
:  I went to Houston looking for a job in this little old bitty office.,['Explain']
There was a guy sitting at the desk.,['Explain']
"He said, um, “What will you do?” ",['Explain']
"And I said, “Anything as long as it’s legal.” ",['Explain']
"He says, “Good answer. ",['Explain']
How about 40 dollars a week?”,['Explain']
"And I said, “Yes sir.”",['Explain']
This was 1961.,['Explain']
"He said, by the way, “My name is George Bush.”",['Explain']
It was George H. W. Bush. ,['Explain']
Really,['Response']
"Yes, sir.",['Response']
And he was running for Congress,['Explain']
What my job was is I made yard signs with a wooden stake and a piece of poster board and a stencil,['Explain']
But you’ve never run for office? ,['Closed-ended']
"No, never have. ",['Explain']
You’ve just been the kingmaker. ,['Response']
" Well, I don’t know about that",['Response']
"But I, no, I never have run. ",['Explain']
What do you do for a living?,['Open-ended']
"Believe it or not, I’m a toilet paper salesman. ",['Explain']
Really? ,['Response']
"Yes, sir. ",['Response']
Two ply? ,['Closed-ended']
"Two ply, wipe it up, yeah",['Explain']
 I’ve been there 40 years. ,['Explain']
Is that right? ,['Rhetorical']
Yeah,['Response']
"t you’ve done a lot of different things too, and I’m, I’m just wondering how in the world did you wind up in Columbus, Georgia? ",['Open-ended']
Did you take a wrong turn? ,['Closed-ended']
" I was working for the YMCA, and the YMCA here called and said, “Would I be interested?” ",['Response']
"But as the president of the NAACP, I can tell you how I got into that.",['Explain']
"When we were, uh, growing up, about 8 or 9 years old, we were traveling to my grandfather’s house and we stopped at a laundromat",['Explain']
" And when we went in,  they said, “We don’t wash black folks clothes here.” ",['Explain']
Mm-hmm.,['Response']
"Of course, they didn’t use black folks word",['Response']
" My father being a preacher, you know, he was cool, but my mother was ready to go off, you know, and we went on to my grandfather’s house and he got on the phone and he called the NAACP",['Explain']
"About 30 minutes later, they said, going back up to the laundromat.",['Explain']
"And the white owner stood in the corner while we washed our clothes, red as a beet",['Explain']
"So I’m like, Oh man, that was a memory that’s always been in my mind",['Explain']
Sure,['Response']
And how it worked,['Response']
You know what?,['Rhetorical']
 I have a good friend of mine,['Explain']
We went to breakfast one morning and when we left this guy that was in the restaurant with us came out and followed me to my truck,['Explain']
"nd he said, um, “Are you Alton Russell?” ",['Explain']
"And I said, “Yes, I am.”",['Explain']
"He says, “Well, I saw you on TV the other day.”",['Explain']
"He said, “But I got a question. ",['Explain']
 How can you be a Republican and eat breakfast with that black guy?”,['Explain']
"I said, “What did you say?",['Explain']
That guy’s a friend of mine,['Explain']
You’re way off base.,['Explain']
" We got things to do, and worrying about whether you’re a man, a woman, black, or white is not what you need to be focusing on.",['Explain']
Yeah,['Response']
"Well I’ll tell you what, I’ve got a whole different view of you",['Explain']
"You know, my perception was, okay, he’s always going to be over here.",['Explain']
I’m not going to even talk with him,['Explain']
" But this has been, this has been eye opening for me. ",['Explain']
"Well, it has to me too. ",['Response']
"And I can go tell some people, “Hey, Alton’s not that bad.”",['Response']
 He’s alright. ,['Explain']
It’s been fun.,['Response']
And I’m really glad to have met you; I sure am.,['Explain']
People have come to believe that these conversations are possible,['Explain']
"So that in and of itself, I think, is an increase in hope.",['Explain']
"And I don’t know if you can quantify it, hope, but, um, you know, the belief that we can have these conversations, especially in an election year, you know, you wonder, well, is this the right time for one small step",['Rhetorical']
And I think it’s even more important at those times because that’s when we most definitely do not want to talk to each other.,['Explain']
Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory,['Closed-ended']
That idea that if people from different groups come together 1 on 1… they can start to see each other as human?,['Explain']
One Small Step interviews are definitely helping that to happen,['Explain']
But the harder thing to make happen… is to have that feeling generalize… to not be just about that one individual you met… but about a whole group…,['Explain']
"Well, there’s a social psychologist at Yale, Jennifer Richeson… and she’s been studying One Small Step and the impact it’s having on participants…",['Explain']
And she’s finding evidence that… for some people who record with us… this feeling IS beginning to generalize.,['Explain']
"Sometimes people say, well, I didn’t see fireworks, it didn’t change me, but they really enjoyed the other person’s company and they were surprised by that, or They really felt like they understood each other and that really surprised them",['Explain']
It definitely chips away at that us versus them mentality just a little bit,['Explain']
"And, you know, that’s why we say it’s one small step.",['Explain']
 It’s not a magic cure. ,['Explain']
We’re not calling it that,['Explain']
 It’s just One Small Step in the right direction,['Explain']
We’ll be back… right after the break,['Explain']
 Stay with us…,['Explain']
"So, Jasmyn, here we are… the last segment of the final episode of this series.",['Explain']
We made it…,['Explain']
Yeah,['Response']
"You know, one of the big takeaways for me looking back on these past twenty years… it’s related to what Mary Bess said a few minutes ago… about increasing hope",['Explain']
"I think at its root, that’s a big part of what StoryCorps is about… and I don’t mean like cheap greeting card expressions of hope… but the kind of hope that grows out of hard work… and having people surprise you.",['Explain']
"Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step",['Response']
" Earlier this year, in a “Mr Isay Goes to Washington” moment… Dave brought One Small Step to the annual baseball game between members of Congress at Nationals stadium in DC… and he showed a video on the jumbotron challenging them to participate… and some of them actually did…",['Explain']
"And soon we’re rolling out this new do-it-yourself online version of One Small Step, so that strangers anywhere in the country can record an interview.",['Explain']
"You could have a person from the bluest county in America getting to know someone from the reddest county… I mean, for me personally at this moment in history… it’s just really incredible to work at a place where the underlying ethos is optimism.",['Explain']
"Yeah and I think for me having listened to A LOT of StoryCorps interviews over the years… and it’s really beautiful to hear someone take the time to sit down with another person, especially an elder to capture wisdom from their family…  you know, before it’s lost",['Explain']
"ut for those of who get to do this work… we’ve been able to listen to thousands of these interviews, thousands of  grandparents… or parents or couples and absorb basically generations of wisdom…",['Explain']
"And I don’t know if I’ve ever told you this but I actually used to keep a folder of little clips from interviews whenever I heard little gems … that I just wanted to keep for myself, stuff I could use in my own life. ",['Explain']
What a gift.,['Statement']
Very cool.,['Response']
Another thing that strikes me is that after 20 years… the basic idea of a StoryCorps interview really hasn’t changed that much… and I mean that in the best way… it’s held up… like no matter what’s going on in the world… this way of taking an hour to connect with somebody… we want it… maybe we even need it.,['Explain']
And we found something that really helps illustrate that point.,['Explain']
We dug up the very first SC interview ever recorded… ,['Explain']
" I’m Dave Isay, and I’m interviewing Sandy Birnbaum, who’s my uncle, my great uncle.  ",['Explain']
Great Uncle. ,['Explain']
"Sandy, this is a very special session here because, like I said, we’re starting this whole national movement and you’re interview number one.",['Response']
"When they spoke in 2003… Sandy’s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before. ",['Explain']
"The first date, she says, “I’ll meet you in the doorway just past the liquor store after work.” ",['Explain']
"And I was standing in the doorway, and it’s inset a little bit",['Explain']
" And finally I see this vision of purple coming down the street, a purple hat and a purple coat, and I think she had purple shoes and stockings on, too and uh, it  was so glamorous.",['Explain']
" I says, What the hell am I, a two bit farm boy? ",['Explain']
This is such a sophisticated woman,['Explain']
" mean, she’s way beyond me",['Explain']
" So I turned to the doorway, and I tried to duck out, but the door was locked. ",['Explain']
"If the door was open, it would have ended there and the best thing that…",['Explain']
" Well anyhow, uh, the door was locked and, uh, we had just so much fun. ",['Explain']
 Birdie was the love of your life?,['Closed-ended']
"Oh yeah, yeah. ",['Response']
 What did you love about her?  ,['Open-ended']
ou know I’ve never been asked that question.,['Response']
Just her warmth,['Explain']
 She was everything that I wasn’t,['Explain']
"She filled in all the, uh, deficiencies I had, which were considerable, mostly in regard to shyness and to, uh, self confidence and things like that.",['Explain']
"Everybody loved her, and she was a good person to have with you",['Explain']
"Oh God,  I remember…",['Explain']
"Thank you, Sandy",['Response']
So let me ask you a question,['Explain']
"It is helpful to talk about this, yeah? ",['Closed-ended']
 Uh,['Statement']
Or is it not?  ,['Closed-ended']
Is it damaging to bring up? ,['Closed-ended']
"Oh, no.. it’s a good feeling.",['Response']
" Break out crying or you choke up and you can’t say a word, that’s a good feeling? ",['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, it is.",['Response']
"Because, you know, you don’t have to pretend that you’re being a brave soul.",['Explain']
Gutting it through,['Explain']
 It’s a good feeling,['Explain']
 Let me get you home. ,['Offer']
Okay,['Response']
"Thank you, Sandy",['Response']
"As always, thanks for listening.",['Explain']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. ,['Explain']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Explain']
"There, you can learn more about ALL the work we do…and how to add your story to the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered.",['Explain']
"Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website.",['Explain']
"Special thanks to Kerrie Hillman, Mary Bess Ser, Neil Griffith, and all our One Small Step partners… ",['Explain']
Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer,['Explain']
"his episode was produced by MIchael Garofalo, Jud Esty-Kendall, and me",['Explain']
. Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd. ,['Explain']
"Um, and I, you know, I hope that the ethos of StoryCorps, that the idea that all of our lives and all of our stories matter equally and infinitely, the idea that we should treat each other with respect, that nobody’s the worst thing they’ve they’ve ever done, that people should be given a second chance that it flows through the veins of the country and participating in StoryCorps and listening to StoryCorps stories becomes part of what it means to be an American and that StoryCorps grows into an institution that outlives us all.",['Statement']
"Some people have said to me over the years that, you know, if aliens came to earth and they could only find one thing, they hoped it would be the StoryCorps archive because it really, it shows the best in us, but it also shows who we really are and that is the best in us.",['Response']
"So what are your hopes for the future, for the next 20 years?",['Open-ended']
"But, um, you know, it’s been worth every bit of it, and I’m incredibly grateful to the staff who helped make this dream come true.  ",['Explain']
" You know, truer words have never been spoken",['Explain']
And when he left he said at his goodbye party that “StoryCorps is hard work and love work and blood work.,['Explain']
One of the original StoryCorps employees–we started with four or five–and one of them was a guy named Matt Ozug,['Explain']
" You know, but it’s drawn people who just refuse to give up and I think that’s part of the secret sauce and the magic of StoryCorps.",['Explain']
There’s nothing viral or easy about StoryCorps,['Explain']
And it’s very hard work,['Explain']
"But their, um, motto famously was, We answer to a higher authority and, you know, I think that’s how all of us have felt at StoryCorps over these past 20 years, that this is sacred work and it draws a very special person to do this work",['Explain']
I have absolutely no idea. ,['Statement']
I don’t know why. ,['Statement']
"You know, true story and kind of crazy, but our first corporate sponsor was Hebrew National Hot Dogs.",['Statement']
"The StoryCorps team has never ceased to amaze me and, you know, that’s why we are what we are. ",['Statement']
"Yeah, well, I mean I think that everybody when they leave StoryCorps to a person and, you know, we’ve had thousands of employees at this point over the years, you know, everyone says that the best thing about StoryCorps are the people",['Statement']
Lots of people have put their whole selves into this work.  ,['Statement']
Right,['Response']
Me too.,['Response']
"I’ve gotten married, had children in this time.",['Explain']
And we’ve all had life changes.,['Explain']
"So, for this last episode, looking back on twenty years, so many people have contributed to making StoryCorps what it is now, of course.",['Explain']
 So we’re going to leave you with a conversation I recently had with Dave about just that…,['Explain']
"Hundreds of thousands of interviews later, it’s hard to imagine how many moments like this exist in the archive.",['Statement']
"In 1931, a young Native Hawaiian man, Joseph Kahahawai, was wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting the wife of a U.S. Navy officer … ",['Explain']
"Soon after, he was killed by her relatives.",['Explain']
Kim Farrant is his niece.,['Explain']
"But growing up, her family never spoke about her uncle.",['Explain']
"At StoryCorps in Honolulu, she told her sister …",['Explain']
Joy Kahahawai-Welch … how she first heard the story.\n ,['Explain']
I was in a Hawaiian history class in middle school and one of the topics was a very tragic story of a young man who was falsely accused of raping a woman and then the family kidnapped and murdered him.,['Explain']
And they were never brought to justice.,['Explain']
This man had the very same name as our dad: Joseph Kahahawai.,['Explain']
"The teacher then asked me, ‘Is this your family?’",['Explain']
"So I came home and I asked mom and she said, ‘Yeah. That is dad’s brother.’",['Explain']
He had just turned 23 years old right before he was killed. ,['Explain']
And then our dad was born just 11 months later. ,['Explain']
He inherited the very same name.,['Explain']
So Dad was the new Joe… and he became the star of our family.,['Explain']
He was like the sun that we all revolved around.,['Explain']
I think he knew that they wanted the name and the legacy to live on.,['Explain']
 You know… Dad innately carried himself a certain way to make his brother proud. ,['Response']
And I remember wanting to hear more about what happened,['Explain']
" But the gist of it was, ‘It’s just too hard to talk about.’",['Explain']
" Right. I look back and I think, ‘Oh, is there something to be ashamed of?",['Response']
But that first generation needed those years of silence and peace to heal and recover.,['Explain']
And it made us all hold each other more close and more dear …,['Explain']
 Like we’re this unbroken chain of family. ,['Explain']
" We pay our uncle our respects by going to the cemetery, you know? ",['Response']
Taking care of it. ,['Explain']
It’s a humble cemetery in the middle of Kalihi.,['Explain']
And the plumeria tree above his grave has a lot of flowers.,['Explain']
 So fresh flowers are raining down on him daily right now. ,['Explain']
 ‘Ho’omana’o’ is on his gravestone and that’s a good reminder to never forget,['Explain']
Always remember.,['Explain']
"Corey Harvard has dedicated his life to helping LGBTQ youth in Mobile, Alabama. ",['Explain']
He grew up in a deeply religious family… and as a queer kid in the 90’s … he struggled to come out to his parents. ,['Explain']
"At StoryCorps, he and his mom, Lisa Harvard looked back at that time…",['Explain']
"We had no idea, we really didn’t, so we were caught off guard, as you might say. ",['Statement']
"But, Mom, the amount of stuff I was looking at online when I got the computer, that was just me trying to learn about what it meant to be gay",['Response']
"if y’all were Snoopy parents, it would have taken no time to figure it out.",['Explain']
"I remember in that very first conversation, I was looking directly across from you, and you fell into your dad’s arms.",['Explain']
"I know that I was numb in a lot of ways because a big part of it was feeling separated from you, and I didn’t like that. ",['Explain']
"Yeah, I remember feeling that distance.",['Response']
" I think that with where all of us were, it was inevitable",['Explain']
"And during those months and a couple years there, you would come back, we would have more conversations. ",['Explain']
"Of course a lot of it we may not have understood, but it didn’t leave us just reeling, we talked about those things.",['Explain']
As we were figuring out what this was going to look like for us. ,['Explain']
"Sometimes I just go into your room, even though we’ve remodeled, we made sure not to touch that room, and I sit on your bed, and I am really so hopeful that it was a good space because I wanted you to be a happy kid.",['Explain']
"The truth is, I felt so loved as a kid, but, I mean, there’s a part of that journey that no one can join you on.",['Response']
"A hard thing that I’ve always wanted to share with you, the beginning of my sophomore year, I was struggling the most.",['Statement']
"And it was this dark night of the soul where it’s like, can I really accept this?",['Closed-ended']
Have I failed at life? ,['Closed-ended']
"And there was that one night that got really hard, and I remember sitting on the windowsill and just contemplating it, like, what would it be like for this to all be over?",['Open-ended']
"And this feeling that I had is you, and it’s like this invisible golden lasso.",['Explain']
" And I knew that even in this worst moment of my life, that I can’t fall.",['Open-ended Declaration']
And the work that I do with these kids is how I took that golden lasso and I turned it into a net.,['Explain']
And we just keep saving people with that love that you put in me.,['Explain']
 Sometimes I look at you and I just can’t fathom the kind of love that I see you give it’s a humbling experience. ,['Explain']

 My first memory of meeting Angel was in the hospital. ,['Explain']
"When I walked in the room, Angel was smiling the whole time.",['Explain']
A teenager who was… in control of the room. ,['Explain']

"After I diagnosed Angel with the tumor, what was your first response to that?",['Open-ended']
"Before you discovered it, no one would listen to her.",['Response']
Even me.,['Explain']
And… I still regret that.,['Explain']
 But I didn’t know. ,['Explain']
They were saying it was an eating disorder. ,['Explain']
"And, when you go to the doctor, you’re trusting the professionals.",['Explain']
"You just, ‘Okay, that’s what the doctor said, that’s what it is.’ ",['Explain']
"So I’m kind of trying to push her, you know what I mean?",['Clarification']
 And it’s not her fault. ,['Explain']
"Parents, myself included, don’t always see things clearly, especially as it relates to teenagers",['Explain']
But that doesn’t mean a parent’s doing something wrong.,['Explain']
 I never tell someone not to feel guilty because that’s not a fair expectation. ,['Explain']
"But, we just do the best we can to support and love our kids. ",['Explain']

Nothing else mattered to me but my kids. ,['Explain']
We couldn’t rely on anybody but each other.,['Explain']

 You can keep your hair,['Explain']

Sometimes you sink or swim and I got the impression that Angel was not gonna sink under any circumstances.,['Explain']

 I wasn’t ready to give up either.,['Response']
"But I realized, you know, after a while… it was a, just, almost impossible situation.",['Explain']
"When Angel died, I just remember, standing over her trying to talk to her and her eyes was open but she wasn’t responsive. ",['Explain']
And her sister was singing to her,['Explain']
"And her heart rate was dropping, it was going from 180, it went down to 140.",['Explain']
From 140 it went down to 80.,['Explain']
From 80 it went down to 40 and… it was over.,['Explain']
"I wish that none of this had ever happened to your family but she, um, reminded me kinda what I got into this career to begin with for… and that’s the only regret is I wish I could have told her what her impact was.",['Explain']

" It was good while it lasted, but I must go. ",['Explain']
You act like it’s the ending of a relationship ,['Explain']
It is! ,['Response']
"Well, yeah, I guess it is… but–",['Explain']
Because no more mother and daughter.,['Explain']

"You know, you don’t have to be religious to believe in something, ‘cause religion is what you do every day.",['Response']
"And they got a song that say, ‘You don’t miss your water ‘til your well run dry.’ ",['Explain']

I know,['Response']
" I mean, I would say that to people, You know, it…",['Explain']

The StoryCorps’ Military Voices Initiative records and shares the stories of service members and their families.,['Explain']
"In 1942, in the midst of World War 2, the Marine Corps officially opened its ranks to Black men",['Explain']
"More than 19,000 Black recruits signed up …  and became known as the Montford Point Marines … Named for the North Carolina base where they trained",['Explain']
"Most of these men have passed away, but through the StoryCorps Archive … we can still hear their stories …",['Explain']

"I just felt like, oh, I’m a proud Marine, you know.",['Response']
I thought I was something. ,['Explain']
" I wanted to help fight for our country, and also show that we had the courage and intelligence to do so. ",['Explain']
We knew we were the best,['Response']
Well we made it our business to be the best of the best.,['Explain']
 Not mediocre but the best,['Explain']
We’re going to hear now from Corporal Sidney Allen Francis.,['Explain']
"After serving as one of the first Black Marines… he worked as a New York City police detective… and in 2005 spoke with his daughter, Candice, at StoryCorps.",['Explain']
" I wanted to go into the Army, but they said no.",['Explain']
And this was World War II? ,['Closed-ended']
": Yeah. And they stamped my papers ‘Navy,’ and there was no way in the Hell I was going to the Navy.",['Response']
Why didn’t you want to go in the Navy?,['Open-ended']
"I didn’t like the little hats they were in, the little ",['Response']
"So then I said, ‘What about the Marine Corps?",['Open-ended']
"The guy says, ‘Well, you have to go ‘round and see the Sergeant Major.’",['Response']
First thing he said to me: ‘Are you a high school graduate?’,['Explain']
" I said, ‘Yes, sir.’",['Explain']
And I went to North Carolina for boot camp.,['Explain']
And what was that like? ,['Open-ended']
" I mean, they were rough. ",['Response']
"Now, were your drill instructors, were they white or Black? ",['Closed-ended']
"No, they were Black",['Response']
". But see, they had trained under white instructors because up to 1942, the Marine Corps had no Blacks",['Explain']
 And that’s why they were extra tough on us.,['Explain']
They wanted us to make it,['Explain']
"And, uh, we did.",['Explain']
" I was with my buddy from New York, he was in the Marine Corps, and we were going to Raleigh from Montford Point",['Explain']
And we’re sitting in the back of the bus,['Explain']
"Then the bus stopped to pick up people, and the bus driver came up and he said, uh, ‘You guys will have to get up",['Explain']
"I said, ‘Get up for what?",['Explain']
"He says, ‘These white people have to sit down.",['Explain']
" I said, ‘We’re in the back of the bus",['Explain']
"He said, ‘You ought to get up",['Explain']
 And I lost my head then,['Explain']
"I says, ‘We’re not getting up.",['Explain']
"And lo and behold, in not even 10 minutes, in comes police with guns drawn",['Explain']
 And they took me that night to some little prison camp.,['Explain']
" And in the morning I heard, ‘Warden, this is Major Pauper, United States Marine Corps.",['Explain']
 You got one of my boys in there.’,['Explain']
"All the Marines from Montford Point, they were on six by six trucks with machine guns at the ready.",['Explain']
You could see they just wanted to tear that jail down.,['Explain']
"And when I came out, Major Pauper, he says, ‘PFC Francis, you get on that truck. ",['Explain']
We’re out of here.,['Explain']
"And he hollered it back, ‘Thank you, Warden, that you didn’t hurt one of my Marines.",['Explain']
"He said, ‘You would have been in trouble.’",['Explain']
"That was Sidney Allen Francis speaking with his daughter, Candice.",['Explain']
"Sidney died February 15, 2014",['Explain']
 His daughter recently came back to StoryCorps\nCandice: So I didn’t know that story before,['Explain']
"He had never shared that with me, but it sounded like my father",['Explain']
I wasn’t surprised by that at all.,['Explain']
"You know, a lot of Black men who served this country had to also suffer indignities, even while in uniform.",['Explain']
 I don’t think that they’ve gotten the credit that they deserve for putting their lives in danger.,['Explain']
"And coming out of it with scars that didn’t come from the so-called enemy, but came from within",['Explain']
 But what I appreciate about my father is that he used his military service to give him what he needed to build a life for himself and his family.,['Explain']
" It gave him purpose, and it gave him an anchor … And I’m grateful for that.",['Explain']
So what do you want your grandchildren to know about you? ,['Open-ended']
" I want them to just remember that I loved them, that’s all.",['Response']
There’s nothing exciting about me.,['Explain']

Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…,['Explain']

And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.,['Explain']
 Wow. I just wasn’t ready for that.,['Response']
I’m sure.,['Response']
 I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.,['Explain']
That’s something I can’t make better for you,['Explain']
 And I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but… you’ll be okay…,['Explain']
They came back in 2023.,['Explain']
"At 88, Jackie’s health was declining…",['Explain']
Realizing his mom was nearing the end of life…,['Explain']
Scott wanted to do one more interview…,['Explain']
I cannot believe 15 years have passed,['Explain']
I don’t have any more revelations to unleash on you,['Response']
 And now I have an old person’s voice.,['Explain']
 It cracks…,['Explain']
But I still don’t think of myself as old,['Explain']
"I mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back. ",['Explain']
But that doesn’t keep me from doing it,['Explain']
" The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot. ",['Explain']
"He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous",['Explain']
But my world is really getting smaller. ,['Response']
Words don’t come that easily to me now.,['Explain']
It’s really scary,['Explain']
" The other day, I couldn’t remember my cell phone number",['Explain']
" I recognize this is part of getting not older but old, you know?",['Rhetorical']
"Yeah… You know in our first interview I had said, uh… it scares me imagining life without you, and it doesn’t so much scare me anymore",['Clarification']
" But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it.",['Explain']
"You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.",['Explain']
So when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone…,['Explain']
"It feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice. ",['Explain']
"One of the things every parent wants to know is just, how happy are you with your life?",['Explain']
 I’m very happy about my life.,['Response']
"I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.",['Response']
 I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you…,['Explain']
 There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that,['Explain']
"You can have great friends or loved ones, but it’s not the same.",['Explain']
As you’ve heard… StoryCorps has always been about chasing big ideas,['Explain']
And one of those big ideas is that every single person in the country would one day be able to record an interview. ,['Explain']
"But during our first ten years, if someone wanted to record, they’d have to come to one of our booths in person",['Explain']
" In 2015, that all changed",['Explain']
"That year, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay went on stage to give a TED Talk",['Explain']
"Tonight, I’m going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person’s life, and in yours…",['Explain']
Dave had won the TED Prize…. ,['Explain']
And that night he was on stage to reveal a brand new idea. ,['Explain']
"Here is my wish: that you will help us take everything we’ve learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world, so that anyone can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history.",['Explain']
"Over the past couple of months, the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths, so that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime. ",['Explain']
"Together we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity, and maybe in doing so, we’ll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less. ",['Explain']
Maybe these conversations will remind us what is really important. ,['Explain']
"And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infinitely. ",['Explain']
Thank you very much. ,['Statement']
"And just like that, one of the largest barriers to participating in StoryCorps was gone. ",['Explain']
"Grandpa, tell me about your parents…",['Request']
What was your first impression when you came to America?,['Open-ended']
Can you share one of the happiest memories in your lifetime?,['Open-ended']
Tell me what you were like as a child and how did you like to spend your time…,['Request']

 In this episode… stories from beyond the recording booth…,['Explain']
  I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Explain']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Explain']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Explain']
"A few months after the app came out, there was a perfect opportunity to get people to use it…",['Explain']
Thanksgiving – a holiday known for putting family members in the same room.,['Explain']
So that year… we asked people to use the app when they went home for the holidays,['Explain']
 We called it the Great Thanksgiving Listen… and it’s actually become a once-a-year tradition.,['Explain']
"The hope was that we could get enough people to interview each other… that we’d document an entire generation in one day… like we said, big ideas. ",['Explain']
"Anyway, the interviews started coming in… from people’s kitchens, hotel rooms… and even one from inside a parked car at a strip mall in Iowa…",['Explain']
We asked that person who recorded that one  to walk us through that experience…,['Explain']
Hi my name is Kara Masteller and I interviewed my grandfather in my 1994 Buick,['Explain']
How did you know that grandma was the one?,['Open-ended']
"Well, she was a good looker",['Explain']
 We fit together.,['Explain']
We were a good pair.,['Explain']
"My grandma, everyone referred to her as like a spicy meatball. ",['Explain']
"She swore a lot, but she looked so innocent that no one ever expected her to say the things that she said.",['Explain']
Were you nervous to propose to her?,['Closed-ended']
No,['Response']
"We had something to say, we said it",['Response']
Like you.,['Explain']
What are the keys to a happy marriage?,['Open-ended']
"Well if something happens just say, ‘I’m sorry’ and get it over with",['Response']
 There’s no reason to carry on,['Explain']
" I just say ‘I’m sorry. I love ya,’ and that was the whole story.",['Explain']
I was really surprised by my grandpa saying sorry,['Statement']
I’ve never heard him say sorry.,['Statement']
 How would you like to be remembered?,['Open-ended']
Remem—? Ha,['Response']
Do you want to be remembered as like a real tough guy? Or…,['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, I was a pretty soft guy.",['Response']
 You intimidated me when I was little.,['Response']
I did?,['Clarification']
Yeah. You did,['Response']
 Are you happy about the life you’ve lived?,['Closed-ended']
Oh yeah. It wasn’t the easiest life back in them days.,['Response']

And it was a tough life.,['Explain']
He tells one story about how he was eight or nine and he was ice skating on the river and he fell through,['Explain']
He didn’t have hot water wherever he was living with his dad,['Explain']
So he broke into the school and just took a hot shower in the school.,['Explain']
I think that says a lot about his childhood that there was really no one there to help him get out of the water or keep him warm.,['Explain']
"Last April he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and I had never really heard him say much about it.",['Explain']
 What do you think about Alzheimer’s?,['Open-ended']
Not much you can do,['Response']
I even can’t remember some names now myself.,['Explain']
So maybe I have got it,['Explain']
I don’t know.,['Explain']
" And when he said, ‘I don’t know what it would be like to have it",['Explain']
That was difficult for me,['Explain']
" So then I had to ask a follow-up just out of, I don’t know, self-preservation because I thought I was gonna cry.",['Explain']
"As people age, do you have any advice for them as they get older?",['Closed-ended']
It’s coming.,['Response']
 Don’t fight it. ,['Response']
Just roll with.,['Order']
 I mean real life.,['Clarification']
 Live it.,['Order']
It’s wonderful.,['Explain']
Thank you grandpa.,['Response']
After the interview my grandpa and I talked a lot more,['Explain']
"The last thing he said \n(laughs) before we got out of the car was, ‘Let’s give ‘em hell kiddo.",['Explain']
That’s Kara Masteller with her grandfather James Kennicott from her 1994 Buick in an Iowa parking lot…,['Explain']
"Before this… StoryCorps typically had been recording about 7,000 interviews a year.",['Explain']
"But with the app… on the Sunday after Thanksgiving… 17,000 interviews were added to the archive. ",['Explain']
The app made it possible for people to record even if their hometown wasn’t a stop on the StoryCorps tour… which is important… because some conversations can’t wait. Dave Isay knew that first hand… ,['Explain']
" Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad",['Explain']
"I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago, when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health, was diagnosed with cancer. ",['Explain']
He passed away very suddenly a few days later.,['Explain']
I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died.,['Explain']
" I have a couple of young kids at home, and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session",['Explain']
"I thought I couldn’t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did, but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.",['Explain']
"Every day, people come up to me and say, ”I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother, but I waited too long.” Now, no one has to wait anymore.",['Explain']
"And we saw people using the app in this way, like Eva Vega-Olds… ",['Explain']
"In 2015, her father Leonardo was diagnosed with lung cancer.",['Explain']
After going through chemo unsuccessfully… he went into hospice care at his home in New Jersey.,['Explain']
And Eva used the app to preserve his voice…,['Explain']
"When I was recording my dad, I was in his bedroom that he shared with my mom.",['Explain']
"There was the hospital bed in there, he had an oxygen machine, and he was struggling to breath, but I said, “Dad, do you want to do an interview?",['Explain']
" And he said, “Let her rip,” and so we did.",['Explain']
"Daddy, where were you born",['Open-ended']
Puerto Rico.,['Response']
 And do you know how long you’ve been in New Jersey?,['Open-ended']
Sixty-five years,['Response']
I’ve been here all my life.,['Explain']
" He was a factory worker, worked the graveyard shift, you know so he’s leaving for work when we’re coming back from school",['Explain']
" And then later on, he was a custodian and he was always working.",['Explain']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Open-ended']
 I don’t know…,['Response']
"Well I plan on telling the kids that you were really loyal, a committed father… funny…",['Explain']
"My family’s the kind of family that if you can’t take sarcasm, forget about it. ",['Explain']
"Like my wedding day, I remember walking down the aisle, and my dad was walking like super slow. ",['Explain']
"And I’m like, “Dad!”",['Explain']
" And he says to me, “Shhh, it’s my day. I finally get rid of you.”",['Explain']
 Do you remember teaching me how to swim?,['Closed-ended']
I remember you throwing me in the water and I was screaming and crying like I was gonna drown. ,['Explain']
"And I was like, “No, I can’t swim!” ",['Explain']
"And then you yelled at me, “Well then just stand up” (laughs.",['Explain']
Do you remember that?,['Closed-ended']
Yes.,['Response']
"When we took him home, he came back to hospice care and the nurses were there",['Explain']
"He looked at me and he said, “I think they think I’m gonna die.",['Explain']
" And I said, “Well, if you feel differently then do differently.”",['Explain']
But every day he got weaker and closer to the end.,['Explain']
 Do you think you’re dying?,['Closed-ended']
 Everybody dies.,['Explain']
"Up until that moment, we had not talked about him dying.",['Explain']
: Are you afraid?,['Closed-ended']
No.,['Response']
 wish it wasn’t happening right now. ,['Explain']
What are you most proud of Daddy?,['Open-ended']
My kids.,['Response']
Your kids?,['Clarification']
My family.,['Clarification']
"Okay, let me end it for now…",['Response']
I did the interview Tuesday afternoon and he passed on Thursday night.,['Explain']
"You know, not for nothing but my dad’s a working class fellow, he bought a home, paid off his home, and was able to die in his home, with his family around him.",['Explain']
"For him, that was the pinnacle of what your life should be",['Explain']
And I think that he did achieve his dreams.,['Explain']
Coming up after the break… ,['Explain']
"StoryCorps’ whole business model, if you will, is getting two people together in an enclosed space to talk right at each other, which, you know, when there’s a global respiratory pandemic is, you know, not great. ",['Explain']
Stay with us…,['Explain']
When the entire world came to a halt in March of 2020… so did StoryCorps,['Explain']
"We all were kind of like, what the heck do we do? ",['Open-ended']
"That’s Martin Olson, the director of digital at StoryCorps – he’s the guy behind the scenes who keeps things like our app and the archive running",['Explain']
 And in the early days of Covid… when suddenly no one could sit down together for an interview anymore… he had to kind of figure out how to keep StoryCorps itself running,['Explain']
" I remember we were still at the StoryCorps offices and Dave just came by and, sort of, started chatting",['Explain']
" He was just like, “Can we do anything remote?",['Explain']
"And, you know, obviously looking a little bit panicked",['Explain']
"Like, How can we actually do something that helps bring people together in this crazy moment?",['Explain']
" I had actually been messing around a little bit with remote recording, and, at that point, Zoom had entered people’s lives very quickly. ",['Explain']
"You know, here we come, a non-profit with a two person digital team and we’re like, “Cool, we’re going to build a thing.",['Explain']
"Trust us, it’ll work.”",['Explain']
And just like that…another “big idea” was born… ,['Explain']
And I remember over a weekend basically sat down and banged together like a little basic prototype.,['Explain']
Two people with browsers can see each other; they can talk to each other.,['Explain']
We can record this audio and then we can get that to talk to our archive. ,['Explain']
"You know, that weekend where you sat down to just be like, I gotta build this thing?",['Explain']
"I mean, are you hunched over your computer til three in the morning, like, how are you doing this? ",['Explain']
"Yeah, I guess coffee is an occupational hazard of being both a computer nerd and Swedish–actually my son’s first word was kaffe, which is, uh, coffee in Swedish",['Explain']
" So thankfully that kept me going, but honestly it was a little bit sort of piece by piece, right?",['Explain']
" It’s like, alright well, Okay so I’ve got one window and I can see myself in that one and I can see myself in this one",['Explain']
Great. Check,['Explain']
" Okay, so they need to hit a record button",['Explain']
 Alright so we’ll add that,['Explain']
Did it work? ,['Rhetorical']
Crap it didn’t work,['Clarification']
"Alright, doop, doop, doop…",['Explain']
Try a thing.,['Explain']
You realize that you forgot a semicolon somewhere because it’s two in the morning,['Explain']
" It’s a little bit of just sort of trying your way forward sometimes, until you sort of look up and you’re like oh, I should probably go to bed or I’m gonna be a little groggy tomorrow. ",['Explain']
"So was all of this exciting for you as, like, a nerdy tech guy? Or was it terrifying?",['Clarification']
"Yeah, I resent the premise of the question as a nerdy tech guy, but…",['Response']
"Hey, I’m using your words",['Response']
 As a highly socially competent tech guy.,['Response']
"I don’t remember a moment where I kinda walked in and it was like, you know, Shark Tank and I was like, “Dave, here’s my prototype.”",['Explain']
"hink it was more like, “look I put this thing together; it seems like this is a thing we can do.”",['Explain']
 Next thing I know it’s got a name called StoryCorps Connect,['Explain']
"They’re like, “When can we get this thing done?”  ",['Explain']
You’ve got 48 hours…,['Response']
: Well no…yeah right.,['Response']
 It was a lot faster than you’d really wanna do this kind of thing. ,['Explain']
But it was not like a single ‘just me’ effort. ,['Explain']
There was a lot of different people involved.,['Explain']
"At the time I also worked with another great guy named Steven on our technology team, so a lot of the early interviews are he and I testing internally.  ",['Explain']
"Yeah, so this is a recording from my phone",['Explain']
And I guess the real question is how is this going to come out on the other side,['Explain']
Will it come out at all?,['Open-ended']
Let’s see what happens.,['Explain']
We’ve gotta see if this thing records so I’ve gotta sit there and just record myself I guess,['Explain']
"And so there’s a lot of me just like doo doo doo doo doo, you know,  into the thing and like…",['Explain']
Doo doo doo,['Explain']
"Before we released it more widely, we actually have a whole raft of interviews that were staff members calling family members. ",['Explain']
And this includes you…,['Explain']
 Yeah. So I’ve got one with my sister.,['Explain']
"So hey, how’s it going?",['Rhetorical']
" It’s going alright, how are you?",['Rhetorical']
"Ah you know, stressing out.",['Explain']
"Because this thing tomorrow, in theory, this thing is going to go live and I basically built it in two weeks ",['Explain']
Are we testing it?,['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, we’re testing it.",['Response']
After lots of testing and fixing StoryCorps Connect on the fly… we opened it up to the public…and… people started to use it.,['Explain']
When did you realize COVID-19 was serious?,['Open-ended']
My anxiety levels are always on 10,['Response']
"I pray on my way to work, I pray on my lunch break",['Explain']
 What keeps me going is the fact that I need to keep goin.,['Explain']
I fear whenever I leave the house,['Explain']
"Everyday I wake up and just wonder, ’Is this the day that COVID-19 is gonna come home with me?’",['Explain']
"I’ve lost several people over these last couple months that I wasn’t able to say goodbye to, and so that has been really hard",['Explain']
 One of the things I miss most is giving you a hug,['Explain']
"And uh, when this is all over it’s, uh, one of the things I wanna do. ",['Explain']
"I remember we had this feeling like, you know, this is this important moment, not only do we need to be here to, you know, help people connect, but also, you know, to document this moment when all of a sudden people found themselves in this new alien world, right? ",['Explain']
"This new world was scary, unknown, and lonely…because the only thing worse than not seeing loved ones… was the possibility of exposing them to the virus…",['Explain']
"Dr. Roberto Vargas was the Director of Microbiology at a hospital in Rochester, New York",['Explain']
When the pandemic hit he found himself working long hours in the lab… running countless COVID tests.,['Explain']
Because of the risk… and for the sake of his wife and four kids… he started living in a hotel near his lab… and then later in the basement of their house.,['Explain']
"That’s where he was for this StoryCorps Connect recording… with his wife, Susan, and their 10-year-old son, Xavier, directly upstairs from him… but speaking through their computers",['Explain']
"When I would go to the hotel room after a long day and it was just me there, and it was very quiet; that was when I missed you all the most.",['Explain']
"It got very worrying once I knew the virus was going to be, like, a big thing, and with you gone it was way harder. I just missed you.",['Explain']
"I remember you’d dropped groceries off and put them on the front porch, and that’s when we started talking through the window next to our front door. ",['Explain']
"You would talk on your cell phone, and the kids and I would sit behind the window.",['Explain']
" And I remember one of the hardest nights, I think you were just exhausted, you just had your head on the window and were crying.",['Explain']
"But eventually, you started sleeping in the basement",['Explain']
And I would not let the kids go past the top of the basement stairs.,['Explain']
"We had to stay far away but I just felt better that you could be, like, a part of us. ",['Explain']
"It’s still very hard but it’s just nice to see you, Dad.",['Response']
"You have been so helpful to mom, so thank you, ok?",['Clarification']
Thanks.,['Response']
"I remember, once you came into the basement, the best night I had yet, you know, your coworker had made all these different dishes for us",['Explain']
"You sat at the bottom of the stairs in a rocking chair, and I was at the top.",['Explain']
"I remember that, yes. I even remember the food; it smelled so good.",['Response']
"It was the first time we had been able to connect in so long and, as crazy as it sounds, it’s the best date I’ve ever had with you in my life.",['Response']
"Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to do what I’ve been able to do at work",['Response']
You have to be absolutely everything to our four beautiful kids,['Explain']
I’ve never loved you more and I know it hasn’t been easy.,['Explain']
"Can you guys try not to cry, it makes me sad when you cry",['Request']
"Oh sorry, honey",['Explain']
These are tears of happiness,['Explain']
"Roberto, I admire you so much–always admired you–but you’ve done things these \npast couple months that seem impossible",['Explain']
"What you’re doing is a lot harder than what I’m doing, a lot harder.",['Explain']
" Dad, I just want to say thank you for helping get rid of this virus",['Response']
That’s a team effort and that team includes you.,['Response']
 But what carries me through is this family.,['Explain']
" StoryCorps was always really about people talking to each other and looking back, sort of saying, like, where did you grow up?",['Explain']
How did you get to this place?,['Open-ended']
" During that time though we actually have so much of people just connecting with each other and saying, like, so how has this been for you? ",['Open-ended']
How is this currently going? ,['Open-ended']
"These basic realities of, like, figuring out how to be around each other, how to find toilet paper, you know, which, remember that? ",['Explain']
God yeah.,['Response']
 That was fun.,['Response']
" At this point, it’s been more than half a year that we’ve been living in isolation… and then Thanksgiving comes along… a holiday where we’re all supposed to get together. ",['Response']
"So once again, the question was… what do we do?",['Open-ended']
"There was an older story from before the pandemic…about a vacuum repair guy from Melrose, Massachusetts named Scott MacCaulay… and he hosts Thanksgiving dinner for strangers. ",['Explain']
We thought maybe he’d have the answer…,['Explain']
Here’s his original story from 2010…,['Explain']
My folks decided to get divorced.,['Explain']
" And if you were nice to one, the other one would get mad with you",['Explain']
"When October came, I thought, gee, you know, what’s going to happen at Thanksgiving?",['Explain']
"So I just thought, well, there must be some other people that are in the same boat. ",['Explain']
Why should they have that rotten feeling?,['Open-ended']
 Why should they be stuck home alone?,['Open-ended']
" So, I put an ad in the local paper and offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner for twelve people",['Explain']
People came and they had a good time,['Explain']
"And, last year 84 people showed up",['Explain']
What I do is transform the hall at the First Baptist Church to look as close to home as I can get it,['Explain']
 I have a fake fireplace,['Explain']
 I have Norman Rockwell’s famous Thanksgiving picture framed,['Explain']
And the way I test my success or failure is how long they stay.,['Explain']
"Last year, I had a family show up two hours late",['Explain']
 He had lost his job and they had heard about the dinner and wanted something to eat,['Explain']
". And, some of these people might not have anything, but they always find something that they can be grateful for.",['Explain']
"My goal is always to have nobody sign up, ’cause that means everybody’s got a place to go and everybody’s okay",['Explain']
And that’s what keeps me going twenty-five years later.,['Explain']
So in 2020…we reached back out to Scott to see how he was dealing with this new reality.,['Explain']
"Well, turns out…instead of hosting an in-person event… Scott partnered with a local restaurant to give away free meals from the window of his vacuum repair shop.",['Explain']
"Using StoryCorps Connect, Scott spoke with his friend Loretta Saint-Louis, who he met during one of his dinners.",['Explain']
I was new to Melrose and I didn’t really know people here,['Explain']
. And I saw the advertisement.,['Explain']
I think it was in the paper,['Explain']
 And it took a bit of courage for me to just call you.,['Explain']
What was your first impression of this crazy guy on the other end of the phone?,['Open-ended']
You were so friendly,['Explain']
" I was blown away, all the care that you put into it",['Explain']
It felt like I was going to a family Thanksgiving event.,['Explain']
 And I’m going to miss that a lot.,['Explain']
"Yeah, because of the COVID-19 crisis",['Explain']
I’ve offered people alternatives to us getting together. ,['Explain']
"It’s nice to know that you still want to feed us, but it’s the togetherness of it that’s important.",['Explain']
"You know, all the people that come …they are young and old, male, female from different places, backgrounds, and countries",['Explain']
"And what I find always interesting is despite the great differences, they all have similar things that they’re thankful for.",['Explain']
And some of them will make you cry.,['Explain']
 Somebody will say their son’s now speaking to them. ,['Explain']
"You know, no matter what your condition is, health-wise, financial, or newly divorced, or newly widowed, they focus for some time on good things",['Explain']
And I think that’s \nwonderful.,['Explain']
What advice do you have for people who will be alone this year?,['Open-ended']
"I would say call everybody and anybody that you can think of tell them, “I love you.”",['Explain']
"Don’t talk with your mouth full, you know, we don’t want spraying turkey all over the computer screen or the phone.",['Explain']
But connect with as many people that you think might be alone or would appreciate a call and tell them you’re thinking of them.,['Explain']
"My philosophy is: I can’t fix the country or the world or even the town, but I can brighten my own corner",['Explain']
" It doesn’t matter what any of the differences that we can divide ourselves with, if your neighbor’s house is burning down, you run to put the fire out",['Explain']
"I’m not going to sit around, talk about it",['Explain']
 I’m just going to do something about it,['Explain']
And that’s sort of what the Thanksgiving dinner is all about,['Explain']
"That would be my hope for America, that everybody would just brighten the corner where they are.",['Explain']
"We checked in with Scott again this year, and he’s still running those takeaway dinners",['Explain']
"Last year, he served 100 people.",['Explain']
 It was just a weird weird time.,['Explain']
"You know, and… It is so bananas to think back to it now.",['Explain']
"But I really do think that it generally felt, just, good to do something",['Explain']
And I’m the first person to say that technology is not the solution to a lot of problems.,['Explain']
"ut it is nice when there is something where, like, you can think of a way to do something that just wouldn’t be possible otherwise",['Explain']
"And, again, hopefully, if you’ve done your job right, the technology somewhat melts away, and it’s just communication.",['Explain']
It’s just people. ,['Explain']
 And it continues today. ,['Explain']
"eah. It’s still what we use to record, you know, a lot of interviews",['Explain']
And it’s really opened us up to connect people who have something to say to each other but they’re not in the same place. ,['Explain']
"I always used to joke with people that whenever there’s a zombie apocalypse, right, I’m not going to be much use because a lot of my skills have to do with plugging things together and, like, electronics and computers. ",['Explain']
"But in this case, all these computer nerdy skills actually came in handy when it had to actually wire things together. ",['Explain']
"So you know, that was nice. ",['Explain']
That’s all for this week’s episode. ,['Explain']
It was produced by Max Jungreis and Jud Esty-Kendall,['Explain']
 Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd,['Explain']
Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty,['Explain']

And it’s time again for that StoryCorps tradition… The Great Thanksgiving Listen,['Explain']
. Go to thegreatlisten.org to find out how to participate… in person or virtually,['Explain']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Explain']
Thanks for listening.,['Explain']
Time now for StoryCorps.,['Statement']
"In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV. ",['Statement']
And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Statement']
"You know what the biggest joy was? Finding a smile in that small, sick child",['Open-ended']
 During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Statement']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Statement']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work.",['Statement']
Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV.,['Statement']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Statement']
"We missed every single dinner date, every movie.",['Statement']
And that led into a thirty year relationship.,['Statement']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Statement']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses. ",['Statement']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Statement']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother. ",['Statement']
And we’d leave bouquets of roses at their door.,['Statement']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Statement']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Statement']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Confirmation']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Statement']
And it’s not the glitz. It’s the simple touches.,['Statement']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence.",['Statement']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV. You see everything as an opportunity because you’re here.,['Statement']
"And, you really believe and you live – if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.",['Statement']
I can guarantee it.,['Confirmation']
I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started,['Statement']
 And they would see me again around Christmas time,['Statement']
And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again.,['Statement']
"So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable.",['Statement']
And as far as you doing the business? ,['Rhetorical']
You started younger than me,['Statement']
As soon as I could walk.,['Statement']
 Even before you were walking.,['Statement']
"Yeah, I…",['Open-ended']
I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.,['Statement']
I was literally there since day one.,['Statement']
"I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.” ",['Statement']
"Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. ",['Statement']
"One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.",['Statement']
I have a sense of usefulness.,['Statement']
"And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.",['Statement']
" I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…",['Statement']
That comes from coming from immigrant parents,['Statement']
You can never work hard enough. ,['Statement']
"Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.”",['Statement']
"Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Rhetorical']
Never,['Statement']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Statement']
"No, never.",['Statement']
nd when am I gonna retire?,['Open-ended']
 One day before your funeral?,['Open-ended']
PM: You know it.,['Statement']
 Yup. [Laughter],['Statement']
"You know if you ever didn’t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken.",['Clarification']
I would understand.,['Statement']
" Yeah, yeah.",['Statement']
: You know what I mean?,['Open-ended']
" My father, he hated my business man.",['Statement']
"You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time. ",['Statement']
"But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.” ",['Statement']
I like that.,['Statement']
" You raised all of us, man.",['Statement']
"Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man. ",['Statement']
That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.,['Statement']
Well you do your best kid.,['Statement']
 This is what you do. ,['Statement']
But honestly your best.,['Statement']
Not just your B.S. best.,['Statement']
And even if you fail. It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Statement']
You’re always my barometer. You never let anyone down. That’s what sets you apart.,['Statement']
My name is Rob Rigano.,['Statement']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Response']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately. Yes [laughs]",['Clarification']
 Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego,['Statement']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Statement']
He came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.,['Statement']
"My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.",['Statement']
"What’s your earliest memory, Rob? ",['Statement']
 I rolled my Uncle Charlie’s Dodge into the street light. ,['Response']
"Wait, what happened?-",['Clarification']
" Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Explain']
 Into a telephone pole? ,['Clarification']
Yes. [laughs],['Confirmation']
"Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled. He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.  ",['Explain']
"Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,",['Statement']
"Yeah, I fell out. ",['Confirmation']
" Yeah? And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving? ",['Explain']
" No, the locks were defected. ",['Clarification']
So you weren’t playing with the door handle? ,['Clarification']
No. ,['Confirmation']
I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.,['Statement']
: I know you had trouble with the locks  [laughs],['Statement']
And then another time I bit a horse.,['Statement']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Clarification']
 I thought I did?,['Clarification']
"The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.”",['Explain']
 Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years.,['Statement']
"Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping. ",['Statement']
And he got to know nearly every resident,['Statement']
He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people. ,['Statement']
In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors. ,['Statement']
"And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?”",['Open-ended Declaration']
He just has that sense of what’s right. ,['Statement']
What’s your happiest memory? ,['Open-ended Declaration']
" Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim.",['Response']
 But my dad’s a little excitable. ,['Statement']
"Why do you think that is, Rob?",['Explain']
I think that’s his nature,['Response']
"Yeah? Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things? ",['Clarification']
"No no, that’s his nature. ",['Clarification']
Rolling cars into trees?,['Rhetorical']
 I don’t do that anymore.,['Clarification']
Oh okay,['Statement']
"I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?” ",['Open-ended Declaration']
"Because he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor. He is not as effervescent as he used to be. ",['Statement']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together. ,['Statement']
He is a gem of a guy and we all helped polish him.,['Statement']
Anything else Rob?,['Prompt']
 I think that’s about it. ,['Confirmation']
That’s all?,['Response']
Yeah. ,['Confirmation']
And next year we could have stories about you.,['Prompt']
the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay… \nAnd if you called in the 1980s… longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone.,['Statement']
At StoryCorps… she remembered what this work meant to her.,['Statement']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building. ,['Statement']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. ",['Statement']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth",['Statement']
" It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy. ",['Statement']
But it was our place.,['Clarification']
"You know, it was beautiful.",['Statement']
"Typical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically? ",['Statement']
"But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk… Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something.",['Statement']
Should I tell my parents? ,['Statement']
Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’ ,['Statement']
"The suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that.",['Statement']
 I had a few of those calls.,['Statement']
" ‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’ That’s all we could say, really",['Clarification']
"But I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.",['Statement']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Statement']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14. ",['Statement']
"And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him. ",['Statement']
And my mother?,['Open-ended Declaration']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Statement']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters.,['Statement']
"So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore. ",['Statement']
"You know, and I was still like just a kid.",['Statement']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted. ",['Statement']
But that wasn’t who I was. ,['Statement']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Statement']
That’s what people wanted to hear. ,['Statement']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Statement']
" You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone. ",['Statement']
"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you. ",['Statement']
"And you bent over and kissed me on the head. It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.’",['Statement']
And I felt that things really would be OK.,['Statement']
"When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died. ",['Statement']
And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person.,['Statement']
" Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’",['Statement']
And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill,['Statement']
"And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.",['Statement']
": Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter. ",['Statement']
I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards.,['Statement']
"Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.",['Statement']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019,['Statement']
"After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.",['Statement']
My relationship with you is very important to me.,['Statement']
"Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved.",['Statement']
"And when I met you, it made me feel so much better",['Statement']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Statement']
": To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another… And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.",['Statement']
 It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had. It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.,['Statement']
" We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends.",['Statement']
And we had that book at her funeral service.,['Statement']
" So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief… Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us.",['Statement']
And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind,['Statement']
" I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.",['Statement']
And that was in a big way John.,['Statement']
 I almost feel like you’re a brother.\n ,['Statement']
 I suspect our mothers have something to do with that. ,['Statement']
They might quite well.,['Confirmation']
"Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think.",['Statement']
So what a gift they gave us.,['Statement']
They certainly did.,['Confirmation']
Close,['Prompt']
"In 1931, a young Native Hawaiian man, Joseph Kahahawai, was wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting the wife of a U.S. Navy officer …  Soon after, he was killed by her relatives",['Statement']
Kim Farrant is his niece.,['Prompt']
"But growing up, her family never spoke about her uncle.",['Statement']
"At StoryCorps in Honolulu, she told her sister …  Joy Kahahawai-Welch … how she first heard the story.",['Statement']
I was in a Hawaiian history class in middle school and one of the topics was a very tragic story of a young man who was falsely accused of raping a woman and then the family kidnapped and murdered him,['Statement']
And they were never brought to justice.,['Statement']
This man had the very same name as our dad: Joseph Kahahawai.,['Statement']
"The teacher then asked me, ‘Is this your family?’",['Open-ended']
"So I came home and I asked mom and she said, ‘Yeah. That is dad’s brother.’",['Statement']
He had just turned 23 years old right before he was killed. ,['Statement']
nd then our dad was born just 11 months later.,['Statement']
He inherited the very same name. ,['Statement']
So Dad was the new Joe… and he became the star of our family. ,['Statement']
He was like the sun that we all revolved around.,['Statement']
I think he knew that they wanted the name and the legacy to live on.,['Statement']
 You know… Dad innately carried himself a certain way to make his brother proud. ,['Statement']
And I remember wanting to hear more about what happened. ,['Statement']
"But the gist of it was, ‘It’s just too hard to talk about.’",['Statement']
" Right. I look back and I think, ‘Oh, is there something to be ashamed of?’",['Open-ended']
But that first generation needed those years of silence and peace to heal and recover.,['Statement']
And it made us all hold each other more close and more dear … Like we’re this unbroken chain of family. ,['Statement']
"We pay our uncle our respects by going to the cemetery, you know?",['Rhetorical']
Taking care of it. ,['Statement']
It’s a humble cemetery in the middle of Kalihi. ,['Statement']
And the plumeria tree above his grave has a lot of flowers. ,['Statement']
So fresh flowers are raining down on him daily right now.,['Statement']
Ho’omana’o’ is on his gravestone and that’s a good reminder to never forget. ,['Statement']
Always remember.,['Statement']
Recording booths are places for people to look back on their lives… and sometimes… to look ahead… to a time when they’re no longer here…,['Statement']
That’s the direction that this conversation took…,['Statement']
"Conchetta Brown has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or C-O-P-D, and uses oxygen…",['Statement']
"She came to StoryCorps in San Antonio with her daughter, Nidera. ",['Statement']
"  If this was to be your very last conversation, is there anything you want to say to me? ",['Open-ended']
"I love you and I’m sorry I have to die but I have to go, girl.",['Statement']
"It was good while it lasted, but I must go. ",['Statement']
 You act like it’s the ending of a relationship [Laughs].  ,['Statement']
It is!,['Statement']
"Well, yeah, I guess it is… but–",['Response']
Because no more mother and daughter.,['Statement']
"It’s just daughter, mother gone.",['Statement']
Yeah. ,['Confirmation']
But you won’t have to worry about oxygen. ,['Statement']
I know that’s the truth,['Statement']
No more medicine.,['Statement']
"Oh, to think–",['Open-ended']
No,['Statement']
You just have to slow down. ,['Statement']
"Yeah, I try to do that.",['Statement']
And then I forget what I’m doing. ,['Statement']
"Well, don’t slow down that much. ",['Statement']
"Oh… Well, what about you? ",['Open-ended Declaration']
What would you do?  ,['Open-ended Declaration']
If this was my last conversation?,['Clarification']
Yes. ,['Confirmation']
"Yeah, I would tell you the same thing, that I love you. ",['Statement']
Do you want to be cremated?,['Open-ended']
Yes.,['Confirmation']
Oh yeah.,['Confirmation']
And where you want us to throw you? ,['Open-ended']
"In the toilet, the garbage can? ",['Statement']
"No, not the garbage can. All that, it didn’t make no sense to get me cremated",['Statement']
"Okay, so sorry. ",['Statement']
Just get me cremated and throw me out back?,['Clarification']
Yeah [Laughs]. ,['Statement']
"We could use some soil and, you know, plant a tree.",['Statement']
Oh yeah… That would be awesome. ,['Statement']
Uuuhuu,['Statement']
"Something that can give fruit, you know. ",['Statement']
 That can give back. ,['Statement']
" Yes, give it back.",['Statement']
"So for your great great grandchild listening to this years from now, is there any wisdom you want to pass on to them?",['Open-ended']
"You know, you don’t have to be religious to believe in something, ‘cause religion is what you do every day. And they got a song that say, ‘You don’t miss your water ‘til your well run dry.’",['Statement']
That’s why you’re supposed to treat people kind while they’re alive.,['Statement']
Yeah.,['Statement']
" And when your well dry, you want to see that person again.",['Statement']
But it’s all over. ,['Statement']
Yup,['Confirmation']
"You know, we made do girl… Eventually, I’ve gotta go. ",['Statement']
And I know it’s gonna break your heart.,['Statement']
 I’ll be sad that I’m gone ‘cause I won’t have you to talk to. ,['Statement']
But it’s gonna be alright.,['Statement']
"I’mma always be with you, here.",['Statement']
 I looked different than everybody else.,['Statement']
"There was either white people or Black people, and there was me.",['Statement']
"And so, I stood out. ",['Statement']
"And the cops would stop me sometimes, even as a young kid, they would stop me and go, ‘You know, you don’t belong in this neighborhood.’",['Statement']
"I was living in Rhode Island and Rhode Island School of Design had a, like, summer scholarships.",['Statement']
"So I entered the competition and the art teacher said, ‘They don’t want people like you.’",['Statement']
" And uh, I stopped drawing ever since then. ",['Statement']
Wow. ,['Statement']
Yeah.,['Confirmation']
"It, it, it hurt.",['Statement']
How old were you?,['Open-ended']
I might’ve been 13. ,['Explain']
 Hmm. ,['Open-ended']
"And, uh, people would say, like, ‘You know, you’re gonna end up in jail,’ or, ‘You’re not gonna ever become anything’ or anything like that.",['Statement']
"And I was, ‘I’m gonna prove them wrong.",['Statement']
I need to go somewhere.,['Statement']
 I need more than this.’,['Statement']
And I went to New York.,['Statement']
" And I slept in hallways, and I slept in the subways, and I slept in Grand Central Station.",['Statement']
"I really couldn’t read and write very well, and, uh, when I did have jobs, I usually weren’t able to keep those jobs. ",['Statement']
And then I learned to read and write by forcing myself to read an encyclopedia.,['Statement']
And I applied to go to an art school.,['Statement']
" I would like to hear more about how you built the confidence to pursue an artistic career, which I see as quite risky. ",['Statement']
"It was a little scary, but because Mommy did so much supporting us, it wasn’t as scary as if I was the only breadwinner.",['Statement']
And my joke was always that I did all the cooking and the sewing. ,['Statement']
And Mommy did the brickwork and the plumbing. ,['Statement']
"And when you girls were growing up, I made it a point that we would always have family meals on the weekend. ",['Statement']
"And I wanted to raise my girls as really strong, powerful women",['Statement']
"I would always say, ‘What can I do? As a parent, to make your life better?’ ",['Open-ended']
"You girls would say, ‘I didn’t like when you raised your voice.’ ",['Statement']
And then I would learn to not be so tough on you. ,['Statement']
"But you’re navigating the world very well, all of you.",['Statement']
"I’m 38, the age that you were when you had me.",['Statement']
What advice do you have for me? ,['Request']
The sad thing about human beings is that we tend to remember the unhappy things. ,['Statement']
And I think my advice to you is just try to be happy.,['Statement']
The longest life is short.,['Statement']
"Miranda Duschack and Mimo Davis’ have been farming together since 2012, supplying flowers in the St. Louis area.",['Statement']
At StoryCorps Miranda and Mimo told their own love story as the first lesbian couple married in Missouri.,['Statement']
We met at work.,['Statement']
Right.,['Response']
At our day job.,['Statement']
"And then we decided to farm together…fell in love, got married, at a spiritual ceremony where we jumped the broom because we couldn’t legally be married.",['Statement']
And then the second wedding was in 2014 to be legally married,['Statement']
Right,['Confirmation']
Do you remember this?,['Clarification']
When we had August. ,['Statement']
"Do you remember how I pushed August out, ok…",['Statement']
"What do you mean, do I remember that?",['Clarification']
Yeah. But they didn’t know how to fill out the birth certificate.,['Statement']
 I do remember that.,['Confirmation']
"o, I was making a fact sheet to leave at the nurse’s station about how to register. Um…",['Statement']
 It’s okay. It’s okay. You can have you some tears.,['Statement']
"I just felt like we were total freaks, man.",['Statement']
"We weren’t freaks, we were just firsts.",['Statement']
We were just first.,['Statement']
And it was really embarrassing for me that we fought so hard to get married and then we got divorced. ,['Statement']
" But, you know, that was part of the rights that we fought for.",['Statement']
"I know. I mean, I would say that to people, You know, it…",['Statement']
"And that’s all part of the package, right? ",['Rhetorical']
You get to be married and then you get to be divorced. I,['Statement']
" Right. I was like, just like straight people. ",['Statement']
Just like straight people [laughs] Right. ,['Statement']
I can get divorced. I can get divorced. It didn’t necessarily pan out the way we thought it would be…,['Statement']
 But we’re still in it. We’re still farming partners,['Statement']
 We’re raising a beautiful son.,['Statement']
These are gorgeous flowers sitting in front of us. ,['Statement']
"And Mimo Davis, I’m going to say right now, I still really love you and care about you.",['Statement']
"Of course, of course, I love you and care about you too. ",['Statement']
I mean that was never in question for me.,['Statement']

"He wanted to record with his wife Arshe to leave something behind for their 3 year old daughter Radiyya, who they adopted from Pakistan.",['Statement']
"You and I would stay up till 12 o’clock at night, waiting to make that phone call to Pakistan, reminding them that we were inquiring about a child. ",['Statement']
"And they would always say, ‘There’s no child for you.’ ",['Statement']
"You know, I’ve wanted to be a father since I was a little kid.",['Statement']
"And I think hearing those words night after night, it was sad.",['Statement']
"But, the moment they said, ‘We have a baby for you,’ I just remember this feeling of joy. ",['Statement']
Yeah. ,['Confirmation']
Seeing her for the first time and holding her was just the most gorgeous moment of my life.,['Statement']
"So, do you remember the day when you got your full diagnosis?",['Prompt']
"They called and they said, ‘You probably have a year to live.’ ",['Statement']
But It didn’t feel like all bad news. ,['Statement']
Hmm.,['Statement']
"Like, think about the 40 years that God has given me. ",['Statement']
What a beautiful life.,['Statement']
What a purposeful life.,['Statement']
What a blessed life.,['Statement']
"But, Radiyya is always asking, ‘Are you better now?’",['Open-ended']
" You know, I say, ‘Abba is not going to get better.’ ",['Response']
"And when she says, ‘But then I’ll cry and I’ll cry.’ ",['Statement']
"I remember saying to her, ‘Aap insaan ho. Ronaa theek hay.’",['Statement']
"You’re a human being, so it’s okay to cry, to be sad.",['Statement']
And you’ve told me that one of the hardest things you imagine is explaining to her where I am.,['Statement']
"Yeah, When she wakes up in the morning and she looks over to our bed and says, ‘Where’s Abba?’",['Statement']
And you’re in the bathroom.,['Statement']
I can’t but think about that moment when I’m going to have to answer that differently. ,['Statement']
That’s going to be a hard one for me. ,['Statement']
"You know, I feel a lot of sorrow in my heart thinking about that moment.",['Statement']
 Yeah.,['Confirmation']
"But, even though I won’t be there physically, just know that I’ll be there spiritually. ",['Statement']
You won’t be alone,['Statement']
"So many people have said, ‘We’re praying for a miracle.’",['Statement']
But I always chuckle at that because I feel like my entire life has been a miracle. ,['Statement']
And one of them is finding you. ,['Statement']
"What you’ve done for me, waking up in the middle of the night, almost every night for the past three months, because I’m in pain.",['Statement']

Yeah.,['Confirmation']
 You know I’m just grateful for each moment that we get.,['Statement']

 I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.,['Statement']

They came back in 2023.,['Statement']

And now I have an old person’s voice. It cracks…,['Statement']
But I still don’t think of myself as old.,['Clarification']
"I mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back. ",['Statement']
But that doesn’t keep me from doing it. ,['Clarification']
"The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot.",['Statement']
"He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.",['Statement']
But my world is really getting smaller. ,['Statement']
Words don’t come that easily to me now.,['Statement']

"But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it. ",['Statement']
"You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.",['Statement']
So when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone… ,['Statement']
"It feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice. ",['Statement']

I’m very happy about my life.,['Statement']
"I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.",['Statement']
"I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you… There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that. You can have great friends or loved ones, but it’s not the same.",['Statement']
"In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV.",['Statement']
And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Explain']
You know what the biggest joy was?,['Open-ended']
"Finding a smile in that small, sick child.",['Explain']
That just made my week.,['Statement']
During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Statement']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Explain']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work.",['Statement']
Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV.,['Explain']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Explain']
"We missed every single dinner date, every movie.",['Explain']
And that led into a thirty year relationship.,['Explain']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Explain']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses.",['Explain']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Explain']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother.",['Explain']
And we’d leave bouquets of roses at their door.,['Explain']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Explain']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Explain']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Statement']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Statement']
And it’s not the glitz.,['Explain']
It’s the simple touches.,['Explain']

I thank you so much just for being in my life.,['Response']

Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Statement']
Mary lives in Minneapolis.,['Statement']
And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide.,['Explain']
"If it wasn’t for Mary, I don’t know where I would be as a grieving mother.",['Explain']
"Well, I know that I wouldn’t be here.",['Explain']
"Mary’s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.",['Explain']
But there’s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work…,['Explain']
Her connection to the man who killed her son…,['Explain']
My name is Mary Johnson.,['Statement']
I am Oshea Israel.,['Statement']
My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I’m her second son.,['Explain']
"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Statement']
I’m Jasmyn Morris…,['Statement']
And I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Statement']
This week… a story you have to hear to believe.,['Statement']
"Let’s start at the beginning… in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis…",['Statement']
"My son, Laramiun, was intelligent.",['Explain']
Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level.,['Explain']
"He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy.",['Explain']
"He grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.",['Explain']
Fast forward to 1993…when Laramiun was 20…,['Explain']
"He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that’s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.",['Explain']
"One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time.",['Explain']
They got into a fight… and Oshea shot and killed him.,['Explain']
Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.,['Explain']
"And over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son.",['Explain']
And after a decade of trying to find peace… she decided to try something different… to visit Oshea in prison.,['Explain']
"I’m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.",['Explain']
"That’s Regina Irwin, one of Mary’s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day…",['Explain']
"As Mary was walking up to go to the prison, she stopped and she looked at me, and she said, “Regina, I can’t do it.”",['Explain']
And Mary was bending down almost like she was in labor.,['Explain']
"And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom.",['Explain']
"And when she came out, she had prayed… and she was ready to go in.",['Explain']
"As we were sitting at the table to meet Oshea, they had left a pitcher of water but they didn’t leave a glass for the man that had taken her son’s life",['Explain']
And Mary said “I will not sit here and not allow him to have a glass that he can drink water from just like everyone else here.”,['Explain']
And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink.,['Explain']
We’ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next.,['Explain']
This is from a conversation they had in 2011… shortly after Oshea finished serving his sentence.,['Explain']
You and I met at Stillwater Prison.,['Statement']
"I wanted to know if you were in the same mindset of what I remembered from court, where I wanted to go over and hurt you.",['Statement']
But you were not that 16-year-old.,['Explain']
You were a grown man.,['Explain']
I shared with you about my son.,['Explain']
And he became human to me.,['Explain']
"You know, when I met you it was like, ok, this guy is real.",['Explain']
"And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can– just hug you like I would my own mother, you know",['Explain']
"After you left the room, I began to say: ”I just hugged the man that murdered my son.” ",['Explain']
"And I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you– I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you. ",['Explain']
As far as receiving forgiveness from you– sometimes I still don’t know how to take it because I haven’t totally forgiven myself yet.,['Explain']
It’s something that I’m learning from you – I won’t say that I have learned yet– because it’s still a process that I’m going through.,['Explain']
I treat you as I would treat my son.,['Statement']
And our relationship is beyond belief.,['Explain']
We live next door to one another.,['Explain']
So you can see what I’m doing– you know first hand.,['Statement']
We actually bump into each other all the time leaving in and out of the house.,['Statement']
"And, you know, our conversations, they come from ”Boy, how come you ain’t called over here to check on me in a couple of days? You ain’t even asked me if I need my garbage to go out!”",['Explain']
I find those things funny because it’s a relationship with a mother for real.,['Statement']
"Well, my natural son is no longer here.",['Statement']
I didn’t see him graduate. ,['Statement']
Now you’re going to college.,['Statement']
I’ll have the opportunity to see you graduate.,['Explain']
I didn’t see him getting married.,['Explain']
"Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to experience that with you. ",['Statement']
Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation.,['Statement']
It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.,['Explain']
You still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you– it’s amazing.,['Explain']
"I know it’s not an easy thing, you know, to be able to share our story together.",['Statement']
"Even with us sitting here looking at each other right now, I know it’s not an easy thing.",['Explain']
So I admire that you can do this,['Explain']
"I love you, lady.",['Open-ended Declaration']
"I love you too, son.",['Response']
After that interview aired on NPR… Mary and Oshea continued sharing their story far beyond Minneapolis.,['Statement']
"They hit the road… visiting churches, synagogues, and prisons…=",['Explain']
We were invited to a lot of different places.,['Statement']
"We’ve had a lot of moments, us walking through the airports together, trying to figure out where we’re going.",['Explain']
"And as we share our story, we still get to hear each other’s parts which brings us even more closer.",['Explain']
"And it seemed like the mission kind of took off, even to the point where it grew its own legs and started running.",['Explain']
They were on every national media outlet you can think of and international too.,['Explain']
She spoke at conferences around the world on love and forgiveness and met with world leaders.,['Explain']
President Barack Obama even thanked her for her service.,['Explain']
That’s all because of how Mary has helped other families who have lost children to homicide.,['Explain']
"She started an organization in 2005 called From Death to Life… that provides healing groups for mothers on both sides of a tragedy, and encourages forgiveness when mothers are ready.",['Explain']
And through her work… she met the love of her life… a man named Ed Roy. ,['Explain']
"When my first-born and my one and only son was murdered, my daughters had asked me to go to the church to hear you speak.",['Statement']
"I wasn’t ready for the forgiveness part, but I was at a loss.",['Explain']
"Like I shared with you, I thought God took my boy and was punishing me for my own crimes.",['Explain']
I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old.,['Explain']
"But with you being there, I saw hope.",['Explain']
You took me under your wing; that’s why I called you my angel.,['Explain']
"Then I remember, I had that dream — that was just before our wedding.",['Explain']
"And your son was saying, ”Yeah, Mom! Alright!” You know, ”Right on!” ",['Explain']
"And my son was saying, ”Yeah, Dad. ‘Bout time you got it right!”",['Explain']
"As the years and time goes by, you know where I’ve been.",['Statement']
You know where I hurt.,['Explain']
And I know you take care of me when I’m not doing well.,['Statement']
The anniversary is coming up of my son’s murder and I’m grateful to have someone there that has experienced the same thing that I have.,['Explain']
That empty hole is always going to be there in our hearts.,['Explain']
"But I feel like when we together and we able to listen to one another’s heartbeats, it says a lot.",['Explain']
I’m thankful; I really am.,['Open-ended Declaration']
You’re a good man.,['Open-ended Declaration']
They recorded that interview in 2017.,['Statement']
"But recently, Ed has had to care for Mary in an entirely different way.",['Explain']
Stay with us…,['Order']
10 years after we first met Mary… she was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia… sometimes described as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s all rolled into one.,['Statement']
"And her husband, Ed, has been her main caretaker.",['Statement']
Just a few months ago… the two of them sat down for another interview.,['Explain']
There was a lot of things that neither one of us didn’t understand.,['Statement']
"It was things like leaving something on the stove, parking your car a few houses down the street.",['Explain']
"And as it progressed, we started understanding together what we was up against.",['Explain']
"Like, when you started seeing things — the invisible people.",['Explain']
"And we talked about it, honey.",['Explain']
"You know, we made humor out of them.",['Explain']
We call them the little people,['Explain']
Like when you had several bowls of cereal out and you was feeding them.,['Explain']
"And I said, “You giving all my Cap’n Crunch to the little people. What about me?”",['Explain']
"And you started laughing, you know.",['Explain']
We have so many moments.,['Explain']
"Yeah, I need to write them down.",['Statement']
They are written down.,['Statement']
"They are written down in our hearts, honey.",['Explain']
Sometimes I think about when people say that a mind is a terrible thing to waste. ,['Explain']
…to waste. yeah.,['Statement']
But you know what?,['Open-ended']
The heart is the terrible thing to waste.,['Statement']
"You know, don’t think about just the memory things; we’re here to remember for each other.",['Explain']
Don’t worry about the reading because I’m here and read to you. ,['Explain']
How many men would do the things that you do as far as taking care of me?,['Open-ended']
Like putting on my shoes today.,['Explain']
That’s what it’s all about.,['Response']
"You know, it’s about us taking care of one another.",['Statement']
"You’ve given me, Mary, a reason for living.",['Explain']
"I always told you that, though.",['Explain']
So that’s what I see you doing and giving to other people is hope.,['Explain']
You have to have some kind of hope to hold on to.,['Explain']
"When you don’t have that, you don’t have nothing.",['Explain']
"So, it’s true.",['Statement']
"It’s true what they say about when, uh, when they say wait on God, that he’ll send you that person.",['Explain']
"You know, he knew what was in my heart.",['Explain']
I love you.,['Open-ended Declaration']
I love you.,['Response']
When word of Mary’s illness started to circulate among the families she’s helped… that’s when the visits we told you about earlier began…,['Statement']
You’ve got a full slate of visitors for today.,['Statement']
Why are you saying somebody wants to come and sit and talk to me?,['Open-ended']
"Oh Mary, the world would be lined up if they were invited.",['Explain']
That’s Brian Mogren.,['Explain']
"One of Mary’s close friends and the Director of the St. Jane House, where Mary’s healing groups have been meeting for more than 15 years.",['Explain']
He started hosting “Thursdays with Mary” … so family and friends… including those Mary has helped… can now help her remember her impact.,['Explain']
And at Mary’s request… Brian’s been recording these conversations.,['Explain']
"When I saw Brian’s note about meeting with you on Thursdays, I’m like, Oh, let me get my name on that list.",['Statement']
Cause I want to see my friend.,['Explain']
Yeah. I’m so glad that you did.,['Statement']
That’s Mary’s longtime friend Gwen Chandler.,['Statement']
"Baby, you will never have any idea how much you’ve influenced people’s lives.",['Statement']
And people will be saying your name for generations and generations. ,['Explain']
"I met someone recently, her brother was murdered when she was younger, and she wants to meet the person who killed her brother. ",['Statement']
Michele Braley is a social worker who was also with Mary at the prison the day that Mary met Oshea… And they’ve been friends ever since…,['Explain']
"And she said, partly, she had the courage to do that because she knew of your story and that you met Oshea.",['Explain']
She’s never met you but you gave her courage.,['Explain']
"You know, we don’t know all the lives we impact, do we?",['Rhetorical']
"You know, but I wanted to get a chance to tell you that, Mary.",['Statement']
And despite her illness…Mary’s still been helping to run her healing group for mothers every other Saturday…,['Explain']
My name is Constance Styles and my son Dante Gray was murdered in 1994.,['Statement']
Well I’m Ebony Robinson.,['Statement']
"My son’s name is Andre Riley Jr and I lost him July 3rd, 2016.",['Statement']
"My son was murdered in 2016, December 25th.",['Statement']
My name is Angel Cradle.,['Statement']
The loss of my son Dewayne Tyson Sr. happened in 2007 and the loss of my grandson Dewayne Tyson Jr. happened in 2018.,['Statement']
"My name is Ann and my son, Maurice Wilson, was killed October the sixth, 1997. ",['Statement']
"My name is Princess Titus and my son, Anthony Titus, was hit by a bullet intended for another child two weeks after his 16th birthday, right before the fireworks on July 4th, 2010.",['Statement']
Some of the mothers who were there this particular day… turned the tables on Mary…,['Statement']
"Do you mind if we spend some time sharing with you, Mother Mary, what you mean to us?",['Open-ended']
I remember calling Mary around Mother’s Day.,['Statement']
"She said, this is just how it gets around Mother’s Day and holidays are gonna be like that.",['Explain']
So to have a woman who did walk that walk to let me know that I was not crazy and that we were not alone.,['Explain']
Loneliness doesn’t help grief and Mary did not allow us to be lonely.,['Explain']
"So we’re forever grateful to you, Ms. Mary.",['Statement']
"It’s not a happy situation, but we are blessed to be able to have you as our shepherd.",['Explain']
"Ooh, sister Mary, you mean the world to me.",['Statement']
I admire you so much.,['Statement']
"No matter how hard things have been for you lately, you are still here teaching us and showing us what true love is.",['Explain']
I think we all in tears around the table now.,['Statement']
"So Mary, thank you for modeling… shining your little light everywhere you go.",['Explain']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Statement']
"Love you, ladies.",['Open-ended Declaration']
We love you.,['Response']
"Appreciate you so much, you don’t know.",['Open-ended Declaration']
But for all that’s happened over the past year… there was one person who hadn’t had this kind of conversation with Mary yet… Oshea.,['Statement']
Her illness has affected him too. It’s hard to see this woman who has meant so much to him declining.,['Explain']
"She’s not able to travel anymore or share their story together, which was such a big part of his life.",['Explain']
It gave him purpose.,['Explain']
"So as much as she still means to him, he’s been hesitant to talk with her directly about her health.",['Explain']
"But finally, this summer, Oshea decided to sit down with Mary again… and StoryCorps was there to record it.",['Explain']
"Well Mary, it’s been 12 years since we sat down for our first StoryCorps interview and it’s more emotional for me this time.",['Statement']
"You know, with everything that we’ve been through and we’ve dealt with and everything that’s going on now.",['Explain']
"You know, it hurts to see.",['Explain']
I’m used to the lady that fusses at me all the time.,['Explain']
But you’re strong and you’re going to fight for whatever you believe in.,['Explain']
And I still see you fighting.,['Explain']
 I’m glad to see you.,['Statement']
I’m glad to see how you’re doing.,['Statement']
So I thank God for that chance today.,['Statement']
A lot has changed.,['Statement']
"I, myself, have two children: my son, he’s three.",['Statement']
And a little girl.,['Statement']
She’s how old now?,['Open-ended']
She’s six years old now.,['Statement']
I remember when she was born you helped me get the car seat for her.,['Explain']
"But since we were living next door to each other, you left me for another fella.",['Explain']
His name is Ed,['Statement']
I remember when I first got wind of you and Ed going out on dates.,['Statement']
"I’m like, wait, what’s going on?",['Open-ended']
You was mine.,['Statement']
"But you all blessed me with the opportunity to not only be present in the wedding but to walk you down the aisle, that was, like, again, your words: beyond belief.",['Explain']
I’m proud of you.,['Statement']
I’ve been proud for a while.,['Statement']
It has been an amazing journey.,['Statement']
"From a hug to you becoming a grandmother through me with my kids, to you just being a beacon of light to a lot of people.",['Explain']
"On our last interview we ended it with me saying “I love you, lady.”",['Explain']
And I still feel the same way.,['Statement']
Mary’s still living at home with Ed… and goes to a daytime memory care center three times a week.,['Statement']
Brian has set up a GoFundMe to help support them.,['Explain']
But one thing is clear… even as Mary’s memory dims… her light does not.,['Explain']
"This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine, yeah.",['Statement']
This little light of mine…,['Statement']
"Yeah, I’m gonna let it shine.",['Promise']
"Let it shine, let it shine.",['Order']
Let it shine.,['Order']
Everywhere I go.,['Explain']
Everywhere I go… ,['Statement']
I’m gonna let it shine…,['Statement']
I’m gonna let it shine…,['Statement']
Yes…,['Response']
"Everywhere I go, I’m gonna let it shine.",['Promise']
Everywhere…,['Statement']
I’m gonna let it shine… Let it shine.,['Promise']
Let it shine.,['Order']
Let it shine.,['Order']
"Yeah, Jesus gave it to me, yeah he did.",['Statement']
I’m gonna let it shine.,['Promise']
"Yeah Jesus gave it to me, I’m gonna let it shine.",['Statement']
This episode was produced by Jasmyn Morris and Jud Esty-Kendall.,['Statement']
Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd.,['Statement']
Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer.,['Statement']
"Special thanks to Ian Gonzalez, Gaspar Caro, Liyna Anwar, Roselyn Almonte and especially…Brian Mogren.",['Statement']
Without him..none of these recordings would have been possible.,['Explain']
"Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website.",['Statement']
"There, you can learn more about recording your own interview.",['Explain']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Statement']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. ,['Statement']
Join us again next week for our final episode… as we wrap up this special series…,['Order']
"As always, thanks for listening.",['Statement']
"We’ve mentioned a lot of numbers over the past few episodes… 27,000 interviews on the mobile tour… 17,000 interviews in just one day when we released the app.",['Statement']
But StoryCorps doesn’t just care about numbers…,['Explain']
WHO records interviews is just as important as how many we collect.,['Explain']
If we’re building an archive of American voices… we need to make sure that the archive reflects who actually lives here in the United States.,['Explain']
So while StoryCorps is open to anyone who wants to do an interview… we’ve worked to make sure that stories and voices that don’t often get included in the historical record ARE captured in the StoryCorps archive.,['Explain']
We call these efforts “initiatives”… you’ve heard about one already – StoryCorps Griot.,['Explain']
"There’s been quite a lot… like, Historias… or Military voices…",['Explain']
Our 9/11 initiative,['Explain']
We did one for people with Memory Loss…,['Explain']
…and another inviting immigrants to record…,['Explain']
But on this episode… we’re going to focus on just one of the many that we’ve done… our collection of LGBTQ voices… called StoryCorps OutLoud…,['Explain']
To be in the service for my country is the greatest thing I thought I did but I was kicked out for being homosexual.,['Explain']
When I first came out they didn’t have the words that they have today.,['Statement']
"So, attempting to tell your extraordinarily loving blue-collar parents that you were transgender was tantamount to telling them I was from Jupiter.",['Explain']
"We got married at the veterans home and we said, ’If you came to see the bride, you’re out of luck!’",['Statement']
Do you remember that?,['Open-ended']
"Yes, of course!",['Response']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Statement']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Statement']
"So we thought if we’re telling the story of StoryCorps this season, recording and sharing stories from LGTBQ folks has always been a part of that work and so why is that built into your fabric as a documentary radio producer and the founder of StoryCorps?",['Confirmation']
"It’s always been an issue that’s, you know, close to my heart.",['Response']
I’m the proud son of a gay dad.,['Statement']
That’s Dave Isay… Jasmyn recently sat down with him to talk about the origins of OutLoud.,['Statement']
"My dad was named Richard Isay, and he was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst.",['Statement']
"For many years, he saw only gay patients and was kind of a revolutionary in the psychoanalytic world in saying that homosexuality was not a disease and advocating in the work he did for helping LGBTQ folks find love.",['Explain']
So that was his mission in life.,['Explain']
I accidentally discovered he was gay when I was 21 and our nuclear family exploded.,['Explain']
"Despite, you know, many hints and clues, I was taken completely by surprise.",['Explain']
"And I was really unhappy about a lot of things, uh, and confused about a lot of things.",['Explain']
And I withdrew from my dad for a while and it was about that time that I started making radio documentaries.,['Explain']
"At some point after my dad came out, he did tell me the story of the Stonewall riots, which I knew nothing about.",['Explain']
And it was just a year or two later that I made my first radio documentary and I decided to make it on Stonewall.,['Explain']
"It was the first oral history of people who had been at Stonewall, believe it or not.",['Explain']
"I remember on that night, when we saw the riot police, all of us drag queens, we linked arms like the Rockettes and sang the song we used to sing.",['Statement']
“We are the village girls. We wear our hair in curls. We wear our dungarees above our nelly-knees” and the police went crazy hearing that and they just immediately rushed us.,['Explain']
We gave one kick and fled.,['Explain']
A lot of these folks had never been interviewed before about what had happened on that day.,['Statement']
And I was very interested in what life was like before Stonewall.,['Explain']
"Sylvia Rivera, who’s kind of known as the Rosa Parks of the Stonewall movement, became one of my best friends and was the centerpiece of this radio documentary, which was named Remembering Stonewall, and I dedicated it to my dad.",['Statement']
The era before Stonewall was a hard era.,['Statement']
"There was always the gay bashings on the drag queens by heterosexual men, women, and the police.",['Explain']
"We learned to live with it because it was part of the lifestyle at that time, I guess, but none of us were very happy about it.",['Explain']
"In some ways, was that you trying to figure out this time in your life where there was a secret, like, life before your dad coming out?",['Closed-ended']
Yeah.,['Response']
I was very interested to understand what he had gone through.,['Statement']
"And, you know, once he came out, I had found out things like, you know, he had been entrapped in a restroom, and he had to beg the cops not to put his name in the paper and, you know, destroy his life.",['Explain']
"And he had been a rising star in the world of psychoanalysts, and that star was completely extinguished the minute he came out.",['Explain']
"He was shunned and, you know, refused positions and he was very moved by the fact that I had made this documentary.",['Explain']
"And, you know, it was me making an effort to understand him.",['Explain']
"And, um, that was the beginning of our rebuilding our relationship with each other.",['Explain']
"Many, many, many years after that, I started StoryCorps.",['Statement']
And I guess you could say that there was something about not being crazy about secrets in our lives that was part of the motivation behind starting StoryCorps – giving people the chance to say the important things to the people who are most important to us. ,['Explain']
And that included Dave.,['Explain']
Here he is talking with his dad in 2004….,['Explain']
What truly was the happiest moment of your life?,['Open-ended']
I think I am happier now than I’ve ever been in my life.,['Response']
"So it’s, um, happiness is a continuing process.",['Explain']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Open-ended']
Where am I going?,['Open-ended']
I don’t think much about that.,['Statement']
You think about dying?,['Closed-ended']
All the time.,['Response']
Are you scared of dying?,['Closed-ended']
"No, I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore.",['Response']
"It’s, uh, it’s more an absence of that.",['Explain']
What do you think is the most important thing that you’ve accomplished in your life?,['Open-ended']
What are you proudest of?,['Open-ended']
Very proud of you kids.,['Statement']
I am very proud of the work I’ve done and I am proud of being able to turn my life around and make it into a happy and good one.,['Statement']
Were you unhappy when I was a kid?,['Closed-ended']
"No, I think I was happy when you were a kid.",['Statement']
And I was a good father and I loved having kids.,['Explain']
You think I was a good father?,['Confirmation']
I think you were a good father.,['Statement']
You’re still a good father.,['Explain']
My dad got sick in 2012 on a Friday.,['Statement']
He was diagnosed with cancer and he died the next week.,['Explain']
"And he actually died on the anniversary of Stonewall on June 28th, 2012.",['Explain']
"At the memorial service, I announced that in honor of my dad, we would be recording stories of people who were alive before Stonewall and that’s where it all began.",['Explain']
"And then, you know how I am— ",['Explain']
Yeah.,['Response']
"I’m like a dog with a piece of steak, you know?",['Closed-ended']
"After my dad died, there was no way that this thing wasn’t gonna get done, if it killed me.",['Explain']
"And you know, that’s the way I, I guess, that I deal with, you know, grief or, or any issues, is that I just stay focused on StoryCorps and get something new done.",['Explain']
"I decided, you know, come hell or high water, we were going to do this program, which we named OutLoud.",['Explain']
It launched in June 2014… LGTBQ people from all walks of life came in to tell stories of love… loss… resiliency and creativity… and… family.,['Explain']
So in keeping with Dave’s story… we’re spending this episode hearing conversations about family…,['Explain']
This first one is set in a small farming town in Washington State… where Patrick Haggerty was growing up in the 1950s.,['Explain']
"At StoryCorps he told his daughter, Robin, about something that happened in high school.",['Explain']
There was an assembly that day and Patrick was going to perform.,['Explain']
"I’m riding to school with my oldest brother, and on the way to school, I’m putting glitter all over my face.",['Explain']
"And my brother said, ”What in the hell are you doing?”",['Explain']
"And I said, ”I’m putting on my costume.”",['Explain']
"And he said, ”Well, I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing that.”",['Explain']
"So he dropped me off at the school, and he called my dad up, and he said, ”Dad, I think you better get up there. This is not going to look good.”",['Explain']
So my dad drove up to the high school.,['Explain']
"And he had his farmer jeans on and they had cow crap on them, and he had his clodhopper boots on.",['Explain']
"And when I saw him coming, I ducked around the hall and hid from him.",['Explain']
"And it wasn’t because of what I was wearing, it was because of what he was wearing.",['Explain']
"So, the assembly goes well, and I climb in the car and I’m riding home with my father.",['Explain']
"My father says to me, ”I was walking down the hall this morning, and I saw a kid that looked a lot like you ducking around the hall to avoid his dad.",['Explain']
"But I know it wasn’t you, cause you would never do that to your dad.”",['Explain']
"And I squirmed in my seat, and I finally busted out and I said, ”Well dad, did you have to wear your cow-crap jeans to my assembly?”",['Explain']
"And he said, ”Look, everybody knows I’m a dairy farmer. This is who I am.”",['Explain']
And he looked me square in the eye.,['Explain']
"And then he said, ”Now, how bout you? When you’re a full-grown man, who are you gonna go out with at night?”",['Explain']
"And I said, ”I don’t know.”",['Explain']
"And he said, ”I think you do know, and it’s not gonna be that McGlaughlin girl that’s been making goo-goo eyes at you but you won’t even pick up the damn telephone.”",['Explain']
"“Now, I’m gonna tell you something today, and you might not know what to think of it now, but you’re gonna remember when you’re an adult. Don’t sneak. Because if you sneak, like you did today, it means you think you’re doing the wrong thing. And if you run around spending your whole life thinking that you’re doing the wrong thing, then you’ll ruin your immortal soul.”",['Explain']
"And out of all the things a father in 1959 could have told his gay son, my father tells me to be proud of myself and not sneak.",['Explain']
My reaction at the time was to get out in the hay field and pretend like I was as much of a man as I could be.,['Explain']
"And I remember flipping 50-pound bales three feet up into the air going, ”I’m not a queer. What’s he talking about?”",['Explain']
But he knew where I was headed.,['Explain']
And he…he knew that making me feel bad about it in any way was the wrong thing to do.,['Explain']
"I had the patron saint of dads for sissies, and no, I didn’t know at the time, but I know it now.",['Explain']
"Patrick Haggerty remembering his father, Charles Edward Haggerty.",['Explain']
Patrick was the founder of Lavender Country – which he called the world’s first openly gay country band.,['Explain']
He died in 2022.,['Explain']
How have you seen things change in the way that we talk about and the way we tell stories from the LGBTQ community?,['Open-ended']
"I remember when I did the Stonewall documentary, I was trying to get newspapers to cover it, and I called the major newspaper in New York and said, you know, “we have this documentary, the first oral history of Stonewall, would you like to do a story about it?”",['Explain']
"And they said, “we don’t do stories about those kinds of people.”",['Explain']
"I like to think that at StoryCorps, we just, you know, whisper truths in people’s ears.",['Explain']
And what we try and do is find stories that haven’t been told before that creep up behind you and help you see yourself and someone who you might have thought was very different than you.,['Explain']
And I think we’ve done that from the first days of StoryCorps.,['Explain']
"So I think, you know, nothing’s changed.",['Explain']
"We just, do our best to, you know, help be the vehicle through which people can have their stories told to the world.",['Explain']
More of those stories coming… after the break.,['Statement']
Stay with us…,['Order']
Welcome back – we’re listening to conversations from StoryCorps OutLoud… our initiative to collect and preserve the stories of LGBTQ people across the country.,['Statement']
M.J. Seide fell in love in the early 1990s.,['Statement']
Her partner had already been married and raised children… even grandchildren…,['Explain']
"Which meant that M.J. suddenly became a grandma, too…",['Explain']
"Here she is with her 12-year-old granddaughter, Genna Alperin.",['Explain']
How has your life been different than what you thought it was gonna to be?,['Open-ended']
I thought that my life was probably not one that was gonna be worth living.,['Statement']
"There was this hole that I had all of my life because, I never thought I’d be able to walk along the beach and hold somebody’s hand because I’m gay.",['Explain']
"But, you know, when I fell in love with Mamommy, I knew that she was my soulmate.",['Explain']
Do you know what I mean by that?,['Closed-ended']
Yeah.,['Response']
I’d never felt that way about anyone before.,['Explain']
"And um, after she had gotten her divorce from grandpa Jim, she was very upfront with your mom.",['Explain']
"She told your mom that she was in love, and it was with a woman.",['Explain']
And that was the first time that anyone was proud to say that they loved me.,['Explain']
That made me the happiest I’d ever been in my life.,['Explain']
"And then, when I got to know your mom and uncle Justin, I knew that I had hit paradise because I now have a family that I can wrap my arms around.",['Explain']
Is there anything that you’ve never told me that you wanna tell me now?,['Open-ended']
"You know, you and I talk about most things but this is the first time that we’ve ever talked about the fact that I’m gay and I guess what I wanna ask you is, does it embarrass you to have a gay grandma?",['Closed-ended']
No,['Response']
No?,['Confirmation']
It doesn’t really matter,['Statement']
It doesn’t.,['Statement']
It just matters my relationship with you.,['Explain']
"I always tell you how much I love you, but I don’t know that you can really understand the depth of it, because you’re someone that I never thought would be in my life and I can’t imagine my life without you.",['Explain']
"You have always been a child that makes up her own mind and, I always knew that you were going to grow up to be a woman that we would all be very, very proud of.",['Explain']
"Well, um.",['Response']
You’re one of my favorite grandmas.,['Statement']
"You do, like, a lot of things with me like ride roller coasters and (GA & MS laugh) play poker (GA & MS laugh) I don’t know what life would be like without you here.",['Explain']
I love you sweetheart.,['Open-ended Declaration']
Love you too.,['Response']
OutLoud was started to preserve the stories of the pre-Stonewall generation while we still could… but as it’s continued… it’s also documented several other generations… including the youngest one…,['Statement']
"Gabe Lopez always knew he was a boy, even though his birth certificate said otherwise.",['Explain']
"When he was 8 years old, Gabe came to StoryCorps in Arizona, where he lives, with his mom Chris, and they talked about how a weekend at camp for transgender kids transformed his life.",['Explain']
Do you remember when things really changed for you?,['Closed-ended']
We went to a camp.,['Statement']
"And I met three best friends — Luke, Brock, and Cooper.",['Explain']
Brock taught me how to pee standing up.,['Explain']
"They were all transgender like me, so they all wanted to be boys.",['Explain']
"And that was huge for you, right?",['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Statement']
That’s why I say we’re bros.,['Explain']
We know each other.,['Explain']
Do you ever get scared about what it’s going to be like to grow up transgender?,['Closed-ended']
"I’ve been wondering if when I’m older, a lot of people will try to hurt me or something … or …",['Explain']
Like if they find out you were born a girl and they have a problem with it?,['Confirmation']
You think they might try to hurt you in some way?,['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Statement']
Were you ever worried about telling me that you were transgender?,['Closed-ended']
Yes.,['Statement']
Did you ever try to tell me and then change your mind?,['Closed-ended']
How many times do you think?,['Open-ended']
"I think like, four times.",['Response']
Four times?,['Confirmation']
I was worried that you liked me as a girl.,['Statement']
Because we used to have a lot of fun?,['Confirmation']
Do we still have fun?,['Closed-ended']
"So it doesn’t really matter if you’re a boy or a girl, right?",['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Response']
I didn’t know that you were dealing with that on your own.,['Statement']
"If I’d known I would have tried a little bit harder to have that conversation with you, and maybe start it myself.",['Explain']
"Um, do you worry about me?",['Closed-ended']
I worry about how other people might treat you.,['Explain']
And it makes me upset to think about what you might have to go through.,['Explain']
You amaze me every day.,['Explain']
"And you can tell me anything, anytime, anywhere, and it won’t change how much I love you.",['Explain']
I’ll always have your back.,['Explain']
"Thank you, mom.",['Open-ended Declaration']
That conversation was recorded on our mobile tour in 2015…,['Explain']
"And just this year Gabe, who’s now 16 years old… came back for another conversation.",['Explain']
"This time with his dad, Julio.",['Explain']
Did you ever feel jealous that it was my friends who taught me how to pee standing up?,['Closed-ended']
"No, I don’t think so.",['Response']
"But I was like, “that takes some talent to be able to do that.”",['Explain']
"When I first talked to you guys about how I felt, I was young, obviously, but I didn’t know the consequences that people could have for coming out to their parents.",['Explain']
"We always thought it was just kind of a phase and we told you that, right?",['Confirmation']
And I remember saying that to you because it happened with my sister.,['Explain']
"You know, my sister was very tomboyish and hanging out with the boys but I noticed something different in you.",['Explain']
"So when you came out to us, it caught us by surprise, but it wasn’t a big surprise.",['Explain']
You know what I mean?,['Confirmation']
"I was really happy that you guys were super supportive, because I know that not many kids get that.",['Explain']
"We’ve always loved you, no matter what.",['Open-ended Declaration']
"Like one of the pictures that I cherish, you were in a dress, you were holding a, a toy gun mm-hmm.",['Explain']
And your Hulk shoes…,['Explain']
"and I mean, you know,  even though that time was still kind of difficult for you.",['Explain']
I saw who Gabe was and who he was gonna become in the future.,['Explain']
I’m always gonna be able to cherish that.,['Explain']
How would you describe yourself today?,['Open-ended']
"I’m really trying to up my art game, so I can be a tattoo artist.",['Response']
I bought you a tattoo gun.,['Statement']
"And then told you I can be your test dummy and I love it because, for your first tattoo on a person, that came out really good.",['Explain']
What kind of man do you want to be?,['Open-ended']
The kind of man that can help others see different viewpoints.,['Statement']
And not specifically that they have to agree with that side but they acknowledge that it’s there.,['Explain']
What are your hopes for me?,['Open-ended']
I want you to be happy.,['Statement']
When I leave here I want you to be OK.,['Explain']
That’s all I’m wanting for you.,['Explain']
I don’t think we have any idea what these stories…what this kind of collection of the wisdom of humanity is going to mean a hundred years from now.,['Statement']
But it’s a way to pass wisdom from one generation to the next and it shows the best in us.,['Explain']
"And that’s one of those, you know, those lessons of StoryCorps; just reminds us of the fundamental goodness of humanity.",['Explain']
"And we have to trust in that, especially, when we go through rough times, like we’re going through today.",['Explain']
"But you know, that’s a lesson going back to Stonewall and Sylvia Rivera and, you know, the heroes who fought on that night, that you just can’t give up.",['Explain']
And I do believe that good wins in the end.,['Explain']
"This episode was produced by Jud Esty-Kendall and Jasmyn Morris with Max Jungreis, Von Diaz, and Kayla Lattimore.",['Statement']
Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd.,['Explain']

Thanks for listening.,['Statement']
I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started.,['Statement']
And they would see me again around Christmas time.,['Open-ended Declaration']
And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again.,['Open-ended Declaration']
"So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable.",['Open-ended Declaration']
And as far as you doing the business?,['Open-ended']
You started younger than me.,['Open-ended Declaration']
As soon as I could walk.,['Response']
Even before you were walking.,['Statement']
I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.,['Statement']
"I was literally there since day one. I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.”",['Statement']
"Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad.",['Explain']
"One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.",['Explain']
I have a sense of usefulness. ,['Statement']
"And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.",['Explain']
"I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…",['Statement']
That comes from coming from immigrant parents.,['Explain']
You can never work hard enough.,['Explain']
"Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.”",['Explain']
"Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Rhetorical']
Never.,['Statement']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Open-ended']
"No, never.",['Statement']
And when am I gonna retire?,['Open-ended']
One day before your funeral?,['Confirmation']
You know it.,['Statement']
Yup.,['Statement']
"You know if you ever didn’t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken.",['Statement']
I would understand.,['Statement']
"Yeah, yeah.",['Statement']
You know what I mean?,['Rhetorical']
"My father, he hated my business man.",['Explain']
"You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time.",['Explain']
"But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.”",['Explain']
I like that.,['Explain']
"You raised all of us, man.",['Statement']
"Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man.",['Explain']
That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.,['Explain']
Well you do your best kid.,['Statement']
This is what you do.,['Explain']
But honestly your best.,['Explain']
Not just your B.S. best.,['Explain']
And even if you fail.,['Explain']
It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Explain']
You’re always my barometer.,['Statement']
You never let anyone down.,['Explain']
That’s what sets you apart.,['Explain']
My name is Rob Rigano.,['Statement']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Open-ended']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately. Yes",['Response']
Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego.,['Statement']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Explain']
He came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.,['Explain']
"My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.",['Statement']
"What’s your earliest memory, Rob?",['Open-ended']
I rolled my Uncle Charlie’s Dodge into the street light.,['Statement']
"Wait, what happened?",['Open-ended']
"Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Statement']
Into a telephone pole?,['Confirmation']
Yes.,['Statement']
Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled.,['Statement']
"He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.",['Explain']
"Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,",['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, I fell out.",['Statement']
"Yeah? And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving?",['Closed-ended']
"No, the locks were defected.",['Statement']
So you weren’t playing with the door handle?,['Confirmation']
No. I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.,['Statement']
I know you had trouble with the locks,['Statement']
And then another time I bit a horse. ,['Statement']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Statement']
I thought I did?,['Confirmation']
Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years.,['Explain']
"Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping.",['Explain']
And he got to know nearly every resident.,['Explain']
He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people.,['Explain']
In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors.,['Explain']
"And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?”",['Explain']
He just has that sense of what’s right.,['Explain']
What’s your happiest memory?,['Open-ended']
"Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim.",['Statement']
But my dad’s a little excitable.,['Statement']
"Why do you think that is, Rob?",['Clarification']
I think that’s his nature.,['Statement']
"Yeah? Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things?",['Confirmation']
"No no, that’s his nature.",['Statement']
Rolling cars into trees?,['Confirmation']
I don’t do that anymore.,['Statement']
"I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?”",['Statement']
"Because he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor.",['Explain']
He is not as effervescent as he used to be.,['Explain']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together.,['Explain']
He is a gem of a guy and we all helped polish him.,['Explain']
Anything else Rob?,['Closed-ended']
I think that’s about it.,['Statement']
That’s all?,['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Statement']
And next year we could have stories about you.,['Promise']
For 25 years… the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay…,['Statement']
And if you called in the 1980s… longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone.,['Explain']
At StoryCorps… she remembered what this work meant to her.,['Explain']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building.,['Explain']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows.",['Explain']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.",['Explain']
"It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy.",['Explain']
But it was our place.,['Explain']
"You know, it was beautiful.",['Explain']
"Typical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically?",['Explain']
But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk…,['Explain']
"Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something.",['Explain']
‘Should I tell my parents? Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’,['Rhetorical']
"The suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that.",['Explain']
I had a few of those calls.,['Explain']
"‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’",['Explain']
"That’s all we could say, really.",['Explain']
"But I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.",['Explain']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Explain']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14.",['Explain']
"And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him.",['Explain']
And my mother?,['Rhetorical']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Statement']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters.,['Explain']
"So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore.",['Explain']
"You know, and I was still like just a kid.",['Explain']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted. But that wasn’t who I was.",['Explain']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Explain']
That’s what people wanted to hear.,['Explain']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Explain']
"You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone.",['Explain']
"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you.",['Statement']
And you bent over and kissed me on the head.,['Explain']
"It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.’",['Statement']
And I felt that things really would be OK.,['Explain']
"When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died.",['Statement']
And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person.,['Explain']
"Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’",['Statement']
And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill.,['Explain']
"And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.",['Explain']
"Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter.",['Statement']
I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards.,['Statement']
"Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.",['Statement']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019.,['Statement']
"After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.",['Statement']
My relationship with you is very important to me.,['Statement']
"Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved.",['Statement']
"And when I met you, it made me feel so much better.",['Statement']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Closed-ended']
"To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another…",['Statement']
"And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.",['Statement']
It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had.,['Statement']
It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.,['Statement']
"We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends.",['Statement']
And we had that book at her funeral service.,['Explain']
"So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief…",['Explain']
Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us.,['Statement']
And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind.,['Explain']
"I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.",['Statement']
And that was in a big way John.,['Statement']
I almost feel like you’re a brother.,['Statement']
I suspect our mothers have something to do with that.,['Statement']
They might quite well.,['Statement']
"Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think.",['Statement']
So what a gift they gave us.,['Statement']
They certainly did.,['Statement']
"Let’s go back one more time to one of Dave Isay’s early appearances on the Brian Lehrer show, in New York City. ",['Statement']
This one is from 2004…,['Explain']
"We’re trying to create an oral history of America from the bottom up and that’s what we’re getting, everyday people, just regular people talking in the booth and it’s been incredibly gratifying.",['Statement']
"And so I know you’re a big-think kind of guy, what’s the larger impact that you hope this will have on America if your vision really succeeds in getting a lot of people around America doing this?",['Open-ended']
It’s a project about getting people to listen to each other.,['Response']
"I mean, we live in such a culture of, you know, even when you look at the best seller list, you’ve got these books that are all the way on the right and all the way on the left.",['Explain']
And it just seems like everybody is screaming at each other.,['Explain']
There’s just this lack of real honest communication and it’s simply about getting people to sit down and talk to each other and listen.,['Explain']
So now you’re going to get diehard Democrats and diehard Republicans to the booth to really listen to each other about where their views come from?,['Closed-ended']
"Hey, you never know.",['Statement']
You never know.,['Statement']
We hope so.,['Statement']
20 years ago… that sounded like a whimsical idea…,['Explain']
But that comment would end up being kind of prophetic.,['Explain']
"In the years since that interview, the divides in this country have grown wider… and the stakes have gotten much, much higher.\n ",['Explain']
Listen to this StoryCorps participant named John Klinkel… he’s a veteran and he did multiple tours in Afghanistan…,['Explain']
I was out of the country from 2009 until about March of 2017.,['Statement']
"When I got back, the country was almost as angry as some of the factions I remember seeing in Afghanistan.",['Explain']
"It felt like a country that was always on the verge of either tearing itself, apart or picking a fight.",['Explain']
And I didn’t remember that from when I left.,['Explain']
So it was very strange for me to come back and feel the anger.,['Explain']
"If you think of being in a deployed environment, you want to stay in the yellow light, cautious, ready to go but recognizing that things haven’t jumped off just yet.",['Explain']
"And it kind of felt like that. It felt like, Ooh, we’re in a situation here.",['Explain']
Who knows what’s going to happen.,['Explain']
Whenever there’s a national crisis or tragedy of some sort… StoryCorps has always tried to find ways to be helpful.,['Statement']
"When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks.",['Statement']
We offered families who had lost someone that day the opportunity to record their memories… to make sure their loved ones wouldn’t be forgotten.,['Explain']
In earlier episodes you heard about how we brought a Mobile Booth to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina…,['Explain']
And how we built new technology to help connect people during Covid.,['Explain']
And so in this final episode we’ll learn what StoryCorps is doing NOW… ,['Explain']
And where we might go in the future… I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Explain']
"And I’m Jasmyn Morris. From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now – celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Explain']
That clip youjust  heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US… that’s from an initiative called One Small Step.,['Explain']
Our effort to address just how divided we’ve become.,['Explain']
It brings strangers with opposing political beliefs together for a conversation – not to argue about politics… but just to learn about each other’s lives.,['Explain']
We don’t expect them to or even want them or ask them to agree by the end of the conversation.,['Statement']
That’s Mary Bess Ser…. she works on One Small Step.,['Explain']
 We’re not asking people to come to any sort of common ground. We just want people to talk.,['Statement']
Because… we HAVE stopped talking to each other.,['Explain']
A lot of us have a tendency to shut out people we don’t agree with… so One Small Step asks us to do the opposite… to actually get to know each other.,['Explain']
"The basis of the whole conversation is, you know, yes, we probably disagree on most things, but we’re having this conversation anyway.",['Explain']
"And by the end of it, We’ll see what happens.",['Explain']
" You know, these days the voices telling us that we’re supposed to hate each other are so loud… and so pervasive… One Small Step really feels like David taking on Goliath… but we’ve never shied from a challenge before…",['Explain']
And there’s scientific evidence that something like this can make a difference.,['Explain']
One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.,['Explain']
The idea is that under very specific circumstances… when people who consider themselves enemies are put together one on one… they can actually come out the other side of that experience understanding and accepting each other… and sometimes they even become friends. ,['Explain']
One of the keys is that phrase “very specific circumstances” – so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.,['Explain']
Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other… but One Small Step interviews are between strangers.,['Explain']
Here’s Mary Bess again…,['Explain']
The fact that they’re strangers really makes it less threatening.,['Statement']
So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother – that may or may not be my story –  it’s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there’s no relationship at stake.,['Explain']
You come to the table with a clean slate.,['Explain']
Here’s how it works – people sign up online – there’s a questionnaire that asks them to rate how they feel about social and economic issues… how important religion is in their lives…,['Explain']
"They can select from a list of terms to identify themselves… things like parent, grandparent or veteran.",['Explain']
And they write a short bio… describing themselves in their own words – and that gets shared with their interview partner. ,['Explain']
Then someone from StoryCorps – like Mary Bess – matches them up with a stranger.,['Explain']
There’s a real person doing the pairing… not an algorithm.,['Explain']
They don’t see the reason why we’ve matched them.,['Explain']
"Really they show up to the interview, you know, not knowing at all what to expect, and usually people realize that they’ve come to the table with a lot of assumptions.",['Explain']
Here’s one example.,['Statement']
"It comes from Birmingham, Alabama… where Cassandra Adams, a liberal, was paired with David Wilson, a conservative. ",['Explain']
"Lemme ask you this, when you read my bio…",['Statement']
What did you think?,['Open-ended']
And please be as honest as you feel comfortable because nothing would bother me.,['Order']
"Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype— ",['Explain']
"She’s probably dyed in the wool democrat, end of story. ",['Statement']
"Second part was intriguing because you said something along the lines of an open mind and I thought, well this would be interesting.",['Explain']
When I read your bio I just thought you were a white man.,['Statement']
I thought I was gonna come in here and just be like… ,['Statement']
I don’t even know what it was!,['Statement']
I don’t remember what it was!,['Statement']
And that’s what’s so interesting to me! Is that I’m just like…,['Explain']
Stereotype!,['Statement']
That’s exactly right!,['Statement']
"So I have to admit it because when you walked in the door and I stood up and introduce myself I was like ‘oops, oops, oops.’",['Explain']
"To have this opportunity to match people, like they’re dating, and there’s always some sort of coincidence that we didn’t even know about.",['Explain']
"One interview, we found out that both participants, I mean, they couldn’t be more different, but they’re both foster parents, and we didn’t know that.",['Explain']
"That wasn’t even a point of connection where I thought, oh, they’re so different, but they’re foster parents.",['Explain']
This will be a great conversation.,['Explain']
I didn’t even know.,['Statement']
They had a great time.,['Explain']
They wanted to go out for coffee afterwards.,['Explain']
"I mean, that really is something, right?",['Confirmation']
"Because we’re told constantly, talking about the other side, like, oh, those people, we can’t possibly have anything in common with them, and then it’s amazing to hear that there’s almost always something.",['Explain']
"Yeah, and it can be something completely uninteresting too it could be like, Oh, both of these people are into intermittent fasting, you know, like, (laughs) but they have something to talk about, you know, that, (laughs) and they realize that it’s the shared humanity aspect of it, you know.",['Explain']
"Here’s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona.",['Statement']
Their connection… was parenting.,['Explain']
I’ve been stretched and challenged far beyond I knew was possible.,['Statement']
You know?,['Open-ended']
"And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one?",['Open-ended']
Right?,['Confirmation']
And your heart just seems to have all kinds of elastic in it.,['Explain']
It doesn’t ever wear out.,['Explain']
Right?,['Confirmation']
You know?,['Open-ended']
Pretty amazing.,['Statement']
So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?,['Closed-ended']
That’s a great question.,['Response']
"My dad would say, “Well you can do that if you want. I prefer this.”",['Explain']
And he let us see that opportunity for ourselves.,['Explain']
I remember when I told him I wanted to try smoking cigarettes.,['Explain']
"And he said, “Well, I personally prefer to breathe clean air, but if that’s your choice, then you go for it” and took the excitement out of it.",['Explain']
"But, you actually told him that.",['Statement']
Yeah. Yeah.,['Statement']
That you had that relationship you could do that.,['Explain']
I feel like I lean toward that with my children,['Explain']
You know I think what a gift your father gave you.,['Statement']
So I’m very much a daddy’s girl.,['Explain']
I connected with him.,['Explain']
He was my junior senior high school principal. So 7th through 12th grade.,['Explain']
"And when I was going into 7th grade, you know, he made sure he had a conversation with me where he said, “You know, your mom and I think you’re pretty special but, because you’re my daughter, you’re probably going to have few friends and you probably won’t have anybody who will want to date you.",['Explain']
"And it’s not because you don’t have a lot to offer, but it’s primarily because of whose daughter you are.”",['Explain']
"The fact that he did that, laid that out for a 12-year-old girl, he set the tone for me to know what the road was going to be like.",['Explain']
"And we didn’t have a lot of conversations, you know?",['Open-ended']
"And I don’t know how often my father ever said I love you, but I know he loved me",['Explain']
Who knew how that was going to go?,['Open-ended']
"Like you said, it’s unscripted.",['Explain']
"We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right?",['Confirmation']
Like that.,['Explain']
Let me give you a hug.,['Statement']
"A lot of people think that, Oh, one small step, these conversations, people are going to attack each other, you know, it’s going to get ugly.",['Explain']
"And honestly, it’s the opposite.",['Explain']
"Some people don’t want to participate because they say, well, I don’t really know, I’m not really well versed in what’s going on in politics right now.",['Explain']
"That’s where we say, you know, you don’t have to prepare for this experience.",['Explain']
"You don’t have to, this isn’t a debate.",['Explain']
"You don’t need to bring a briefcase full of, you know, the most recent articles.",['Explain']
"you just bring your life experience and talk about what you care about, what your life has been like and listen to someone else do the same and that’s pretty much it.",['Explain']
So there ARE some other ways One Small Step interviews are different from standard StoryCorps conversations…,['Explain']
Each One Small Step interview starts with the participants reading each other’s bios out loud… ,['Explain']
And then a trained facilitator guides them through the conversation with questions from a list designed specifically for One Small Step.,['Explain']
"One of the questions is can you describe in your own words, your personal political values?",['Closed-ended']
"The way it’s phrased you’re asked to talk about why you care about something, why it’s important to you, why you believe X, Y, or Z.",['Explain']
So you’re still talking about your own life.,['Explain']
"You’re still telling stories, you know, how your grandfather influenced you, or, you know, you grew up poor.",['Explain']
It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right?,['Confirmation']
Right.,['Response']
"And makes it about understanding, which is, like, a completely different approach",['Statement']
"Yeah, I mean you can still walk out of the room and think, you know, that person everything they stand for is completely wrong, but, somehow, I enjoyed speaking with them, or somehow I kind of respect them.",['Explain']
"This next conversation comes from Columbus, Georgia… Alton Russell is the former Chair of the Republican party there…",['Explain']
And he was paired with Wane Hailes… who was the President of the local chapter of the NAACP.,['Explain']
These guys knew of each other… but they had never spoken before this interview.,['Explain']
I went to Houston looking for a job in this little old bitty office.,['Statement']
There was a guy sitting at the desk.,['Explain']
"He said, um, “What will you do?”",['Explain']
"And I said, “Anything as long as it’s legal.”",['Explain']
"He says, “Good answer. How about 40 dollars a week?”",['Explain']
"And I said, “Yes sir.” This was 1961. He said, by the way, “My name is George Bush.” It was George H. W. Bush.",['Explain']
And he was running for Congress.,['Statement']
What my job was is I made yard signs with a wooden stake and a piece of poster board and a stencil.,['Explain']
But you’ve never run for office?,['Closed-ended']
"No, never have.",['Statement']
You’ve just been the kingmaker.,['Statement']
"Well, I don’t know about that.",['Statement']
"But I, no, I never have run.",['Explain']
What do you do for a living?,['Open-ended']
"Believe it or not, I’m a toilet paper salesman.",['Statement']
Really?,['Open-ended']
"Yes, sir. ",['Statement']
Two ply?,['Confirmation']
"Two ply, wipe it up, yeah",['Statement']
I’ve been there 40 years.,['Explain']
Is that right?,['Open-ended']
"But you’ve done a lot of different things too, and I’m, I’m just wondering how in the world did you wind up in Columbus, Georgia?",['Open-ended']
Did you take a wrong turn? ,['Open-ended']
"I was working for the YMCA, and the YMCA here called and said, “Would I be interested?”",['Statement']
"But as the president of the NAACP, I can tell you how I got into that.",['Explain']
"When we were, uh, growing up, about 8 or 9 years old, we were traveling to my grandfather’s house and we stopped at a laundromat.",['Explain']
"And when we went in,  they said, “We don’t wash black folks clothes here.” ",['Explain']
"Of course, they didn’t use black folks word.",['Explain']
"My father being a preacher, you know, he was cool, but my mother was ready to go off, you know, and we went on to my grandfather’s house and he got on the phone and he called the NAACP.",['Explain']
"About 30 minutes later, they said, going back up to the laundromat.",['Explain']
"And the white owner stood in the corner while we washed our clothes, red as a beet.",['Explain']
"So I’m like, Oh man, that was a memory that’s always been in my mind.",['Explain']
Sure.,['Statement']
And how it worked.,['Open-ended']
You know what?,['Open-ended']
I have a good friend of mine.,['Statement']
"We went to breakfast one morning and when we left this guy that was in the restaurant with us came out and followed me to my truck. And he said, um, “Are you Alton Russell?”",['Explain']
"And I said, “Yes, I am.”",['Explain']
"He says, “Well, I saw you on TV the other day.”",['Explain']
"He said, “But I got a question. How can you be a Republican and eat breakfast with that black guy?”",['Explain']
"I said, “What did you say? That guy’s a friend of mine. You’re way off base.”",['Explain']
"We got things to do, and worrying about whether you’re a man, a woman, black, or white is not what you need to be focusing on.",['Explain']
"Well I’ll tell you what, I’ve got a whole different view of you.",['Statement']
"You know, my perception was, okay, he’s always going to be over here.",['Explain']
I’m not going to even talk with him.,['Explain']
"But this has been, this has been eye opening for me.",['Explain']
"Well, it has to me too.",['Statement']
"And I can go tell some people, “Hey, Alton’s not that bad.” ",['Explain']
He’s alright.,['Explain']
It’s been fun.,['Statement']
And I’m really glad to have met you;,['Statement']
I sure am.,['Statement']
People have come to believe that these conversations are possible.,['Statement']
"So that in and of itself, I think, is an increase in hope.",['Explain']
"And I don’t know if you can quantify it, hope, but, um, you know, the belief that we can have these conversations, especially in an election year, you know, you wonder, well, is this the right time for one small step?",['Confirmation']
And I think it’s even more important at those times because that’s when we most definitely do not want to talk to each other.,['Explain']
Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory?,['Confirmation']
That idea that if people from different groups come together 1 on 1… they can start to see each other as human?,['Confirmation']
One Small Step interviews are definitely helping that to happen.,['Statement']
But the harder thing to make happen… is to have that feeling generalize… to not be just about that one individual you met… but about a whole group… ,['Explain']
"Well, there’s a social psychologist at Yale, Jennifer Richeson… and she’s been studying One Small Step and the impact it’s having on participants… And she’s finding evidence that… for some people who record with us… this feeling IS beginning to generalize.",['Explain']
"Sometimes people say, well, I didn’t see fireworks, it didn’t change me, but they really enjoyed the other person’s company and they were surprised by that, or They really felt like they understood each other and that really surprised them.",['Explain']
It definitely chips away at that us versus them mentality just a little bit.,['Explain']
"And, you know, that’s why we say it’s one small step.",['Explain']
It’s not a magic cure.,['Explain']
We’re not calling it that.,['Explain']
It’s just One Small Step in the right direction.,['Explain']
We’ll be back… right after the break.,['Promise']
Stay with us…,['Order']
"So, Jasmyn, here we are… the last segment of the final episode of this series.",['Statement']
We made it…,['Statement']
"You know, one of the big takeaways for me looking back on these past twenty years… it’s related to what Mary Bess said a few minutes ago… about increasing hope.",['Explain']
"I think at its root, that’s a big part of what StoryCorps is about… and I don’t mean like cheap greeting card expressions of hope… but the kind of hope that grows out of hard work… and having people surprise you.",['Explain']
"Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step. Earlier this year, in a “Mr Isay Goes to Washington” moment… Dave brought One Small Step to the annual baseball game between members of Congress at Nationals stadium in DC… and he showed a video on the jumbotron challenging them to participate… and some of them actually did…",['Explain']
"And soon we’re rolling out this new do-it-yourself online version of One Small Step, so that strangers anywhere in the country can record an interview.",['Explain']
"You could have a person from the bluest county in America getting to know someone from the reddest county… I mean, for me personally at this moment in history… it’s just really incredible to work at a place where the underlying ethos is optimism. ",['Explain']
"Yeah and I think for me having listened to A LOT of StoryCorps interviews over the years… and it’s really beautiful to hear someone take the time to sit down with another person, especially an elder to capture wisdom from their family…  you know, before it’s lost.",['Explain']
"But for those of who get to do this work… we’ve been able to listen to thousands of these interviews, thousands of  grandparents… or parents or couples and absorb basically generations of wisdom… And I don’t know if I’ve ever told you this but I actually used to keep a folder of little clips from interviews whenever I heard little gems … that I just wanted to keep for myself, stuff I could use in my own life.",['Explain']
What a gift.,['Statement']
Very cool.,['Statement']
Another thing that strikes me is that after 20 years… the basic idea of a StoryCorps interview really hasn’t changed that much… and I mean that in the best way… it’s held up… like no matter what’s going on in the world… this way of taking an hour to connect with somebody… we want it… maybe we even need it.,['Explain']
And we found something that really helps illustrate that point.,['Explain']
We dug up the very first SC interview ever recorded… ,['Explain']
"I’m Dave Isay, and I’m interviewing Sandy Birnbaum, who’s my uncle, my great uncle.",['Statement']
Great Uncle.,['Statement']
"Sandy, this is a very special session here because, like I said, we’re starting this whole national movement and you’re interview number one.",['Statement']
"When they spoke in 2003… Sandy’s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before.",['Explain']
"The first date, she says, “I’ll meet you in the doorway just past the liquor store after work.”",['Explain']
"And I was standing in the doorway, and it’s inset a little bit.",['Explain']
"And finally I see this vision of purple coming down the street, a purple hat and a purple coat, and I think she had purple shoes and stockings on, too and uh, it  was so glamorous.",['Explain']
"I says, What the hell am I, a two bit farm boy?",['Explain']
This is such a sophisticated woman,['Statement']
"I mean, she’s way beyond me",['Explain']
"So I turned to the doorway, and I tried to duck out, but the door was locked.",['Explain']
"If the door was open, it would have ended there and the best thing that…",['Statement']
"Well anyhow, uh, the door was locked and, uh, we had just so much fun.",['Explain']
Birdie was the love of your life?,['Confirmation']
"Oh yeah, yeah.",['Response']
What did you love about her?,['Open-ended']
You know I’ve never been asked that question.,['Statement']
Just her warmth.,['Explain']
She was everything that I wasn’t. ,['Explain']
"She filled in all the, uh, deficiencies I had, which were considerable, mostly in regard to shyness and to, uh, self confidence and things like that.",['Explain']
"Everybody loved her, and she was a good person to have with you.",['Explain']
"Thank you, Sandy",['Statement']
So let me ask you a question.,['Request']
"It is helpful to talk about this, yeah?",['Confirmation']
Or is it not?,['Closed-ended']
Is it damaging to bring up?,['Open-ended']
"Oh, no.. it’s a good feeling.",['Response']
"Break out crying or you choke up and you can’t say a word, that’s a good feeling? ",['Confirmation']
"Yeah, it is.",['Response']
"Because, you know, you don’t have to pretend that you’re being a brave soul.",['Explain']
Gutting it through.,['Explain']
You’re just letting go.,['Explain']
It’s a good feeling.,['Explain']
Let me get you home.,['Request']
Okay.,['Response']
"Thank you, Sandy.",['Open-ended Declaration']
"Hundreds of thousands of interviews later, it’s hard to imagine how many moments like this exist in the archive.",['Statement']
And it’s hard to measure the impact of those moments…on the people who recorded interviews…and also on the people who have helped build StoryCorps…,['Explain']
So we’re going to leave you with a conversation I recently had with Dave about just that…,['Promise']
"So, for this last episode, looking back on twenty years, so many people have contributed to making StoryCorps what it is now, of course",['Statement']
And we’ve all had life changes.,['Explain']
"I’ve gotten married, had children in this time.",['Explain']
Me too.,['Statement']
Right!,['Statement']
Lots of people have put their whole selves into this work.,['Statement']
"Yeah, well, I mean I think that everybody when they leave StoryCorps to a person and, you know, we’ve had thousands of employees at this point over the years, you know, everyone says that the best thing about StoryCorps are the people.",['Statement']
"The StoryCorps team has never ceased to amaze me and, you know, that’s why we are what we are.",['Explain']
"You know, true story and kind of crazy, but our first corporate sponsor was Hebrew National Hot Dogs.",['Explain']
I don’t know why.,['Explain']
I have absolutely no idea.,['Explain']
"But their, um, motto famously was, We answer to a higher authority and, you know, I think that’s how all of us have felt at StoryCorps over these past 20 years, that this is sacred work and it draws a very special person to do this work.",['Explain']
And it’s very hard work.,['Explain']
There’s nothing viral or easy about StoryCorps.,['Statement']
"You know, but it’s drawn people who just refuse to give up and I think that’s part of the secret sauce and the magic of StoryCorps.",['Explain']
One of the original StoryCorps employees–we started with four or five–and one of them was a guy named Matt Ozug.,['Explain']
And when he left he said at his goodbye party that “StoryCorps is hard work and love work and blood work.”,['Explain']
"You know, truer words have never been spoken.",['Explain']
"But, um, you know, it’s been worth every bit of it, and I’m incredibly grateful to the staff who helped make this dream come true.",['Explain']
"So what are your hopes for the future, for the next 20 years?",['Open-ended']
"Some people have said to me over the years that, you know, if aliens came to earth and they could only find one thing, they hoped it would be the StoryCorps archive because it really, it shows the best in us, but it also shows who we really are and that is the best in us.",['Statement']
"Um, and I, you know, I hope that the ethos of StoryCorps, that the idea that all of our lives and all of our stories matter equally and infinitely, the idea that we should treat each other with respect, that nobody’s the worst thing they’ve they’ve ever done, that people should be given a second chance that it flows through the veins of the country and participating in StoryCorps and listening to StoryCorps stories becomes part of what it means to be an American and that StoryCorps grows into an institution that outlives us all.",['Explain']
"This episode was produced by MIchael Garofalo, Jud Esty-Kendall, and me.",['Statement']
Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd.,['Statement']
Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer.,['Statement']
"Special thanks to Kerrie Hillman, Mary Bess Ser, Neil Griffith, and all our One Small Step partners…",['Statement']

"As always, thanks for listening.",['Statement']
"In 1931, a young Native Hawaiian man, Joseph Kahahawai, was wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting the wife of a U.S. Navy officer …",['Statement']
"Soon after, he was killed by her relatives.",['Explain']
Kim Farrant is his niece.,['Explain']
"But growing up, her family never spoke about her uncle.",['Explain']
"At StoryCorps in Honolulu, she told her sister …  Joy Kahahawai-Welch … how she first heard the story.",['Explain']
I was in a Hawaiian history class in middle school and one of the topics was a very tragic story of a young man who was falsely accused of raping a woman and then the family kidnapped and murdered him.,['Statement']
And they were never brought to justice.,['Explain']
This man had the very same name as our dad: Joseph Kahahawai.,['Statement']
"The teacher then asked me, ‘Is this your family?’",['Explain']
"So I came home and I asked mom and she said, ‘Yeah. That is dad’s brother.’",['Explain']
He had just turned 23 years old right before he was killed.,['Explain']
And then our dad was born just 11 months later.,['Explain']
He inherited the very same name.,['Explain']
So Dad was the new Joe… and he became the star of our family.,['Explain']
He was like the sun that we all revolved around.,['Explain']
I think he knew that they wanted the name and the legacy to live on.,['Explain']
You know… Dad innately carried himself a certain way to make his brother proud.,['Statement']
And I remember wanting to hear more about what happened.,['Explain']
"But the gist of it was, ‘It’s just too hard to talk about.’",['Statement']
Right.,['Statement']
"I look back and I think, ‘Oh, is there something to be ashamed of?’",['Statement']
But that first generation needed those years of silence and peace to heal and recover.,['Statement']
And it made us all hold each other more close and more dear … Like we’re this unbroken chain of family. ,['Statement']
"We pay our uncle our respects by going to the cemetery, you know?",['Confirmation']
Taking care of it.,['Statement']
It’s a humble cemetery in the middle of Kalihi.,['Statement']
And the plumeria tree above his grave has a lot of flowers.,['Explain']
So fresh flowers are raining down on him daily right now.,['Explain']
‘Ho’omana’o’ is on his gravestone and that’s a good reminder to never forget. Always remember.,['Statement']
"We had no idea, we really didn’t, so we were caught off guard, as you might say.",['Statement']
"But, Mom, the amount of stuff I was looking at online when I got the computer, that was just me trying to learn about what it meant to be gay.",['Statement']
"if y’all were Snoopy parents, it would have taken no time to figure it out.",['Explain']
"I remember in that very first conversation, I was looking directly across from you, and you fell into your dad’s arms.",['Explain']
"I know that I was numb in a lot of ways because a big part of it was feeling separated from you, and I didn’t like that.",['Explain']
"Yeah, I remember feeling that distance.",['Statement']
"I think that with where all of us were, it was inevitable.",['Explain']
"And during those months and a couple years there, you would come back, we would have more conversations.",['Explain']
"Of course a lot of it we may not have understood, but it didn’t leave us just reeling, we talked about those things.",['Explain']
As we were figuring out what this was going to look like for us.,['Explain']
"Sometimes I just go into your room, even though we’ve remodeled, we made sure not to touch that room, and I sit on your bed, and I am really so hopeful that it was a good space because I wanted you to be a happy kid.",['Explain']
"The truth is, I felt so loved as a kid, but, I mean, there’s a part of that journey that no one can join you on.",['Statement']
"A hard thing that I’ve always wanted to share with you, the beginning of my sophomore year, I was struggling the most.",['Explain']
"And it was this dark night of the soul where it’s like, can I really accept this?",['Open-ended']
Have I failed at life?,['Open-ended']
"And there was that one night that got really hard, and I remember sitting on the windowsill and just contemplating it, like, what would it be like for this to all be over?",['Open-ended']
"And this feeling that I had is you, and it’s like this invisible golden lasso.",['Open-ended Declaration']
"And I knew that even in this worst moment of my life, that I can’t fall.",['Open-ended Declaration']
And the work that I do with these kids is how I took that golden lasso and I turned it into a net.,['Open-ended Declaration']
And we just keep saving people with that love that you put in me.,['Open-ended Declaration']
Sometimes I look at you and I just can’t fathom the kind of love that I see you give it’s a humbling experience.,['Statement']
"You came into my life and changed me in so many ways, I’m so much better now than I ever would have been without you…and I’m so grateful to be your mom.",['Open-ended Declaration']
"That’s Corey Harvard and his mom Lisa Harvard in Mobile, Alabama.  In 2018, Corey co-founded Prism United, which provides support groups and access to therapy for LGBTQ+ youth and their families in Southwest Alabama.",['Statement']
"When Robert Robinson’s daughter, Angel, started rapidly losing weight… doctors incorrectly diagnosed them with an eating disorder.",['Statement']
But on one visit to the hospital… a doctor on-call discovered a rare stomach tumor.,['Statement']
"At StoryCorps in Chicago, Dr. Fortunato sat down with Angel’s father for this conversation.",['Statement']
My first memory of meeting Angel was in the hospital.,['Statement']
A teenager who was… in control of the room.,['Explain']
"After I diagnosed Angel with the tumor, what was your first response to that?",['Explain']
"Before you discovered it, no one would listen to her.",['Response']
Even me.,['Statement']
And… I still regret that.,['Explain']
But I didn’t know.,['Statement']
They were saying it was an eating disorder.,['Explain']
"So I’m kind of trying to push her, you know what I mean?",['Confirmation']
And it’s not her fault.,['Statement']
"Parents, myself included, don’t always see things clearly, especially as it relates to teenagers.",['Statement']
But that doesn’t mean a parent’s doing something wrong.,['Explain']
Nothing else mattered to me but my kids.,['Statement']
We couldn’t rely on anybody but each other.,['Explain']
"It was us against the world type of situation that I feel made her stronger, mentally.",['Explain']
Sometimes you sink or swim and I got the impression that Angel was not gonna sink under any circumstances.,['Statement']
"No, she wasn’t.",['Statement']
I wasn’t ready to give up either.,['Response']
"But I realized, you know, after a while… it was a, just, almost impossible situation.",['Statement']
"When Angel died, I just remember, standing over her trying to talk to her and her eyes was open but she wasn’t responsive.",['Explain']
" I wish that none of this had ever happened to your family but she, um, reminded me kinda what I got into this career to begin with for… and that’s the only regret is I wish I could have told her what her impact was.",['Statement']
"And I really appreciate those times, everyone was saying ‘It’s a wrap,’ you know what I mean?",['Open-ended']
"For you to still be there and be like, ‘Nah, there’s still stuff you can do, you ain’t gotta blow the trumpet just yet.’",['Statement']
"When a time when there wasn’t any hope, that really lifted us up.",['Explain']
"When I walked in the room, Angel was smiling the whole time.",['Explain']
" If this was to be your very last conversation, is there anything you want to say to me?",['Open-ended']
"It was good while it lasted, but I must go.",['Statement']
You act like it’s the ending of a relationship,['Statement']
"Well, yeah, I guess it is… but–",['Statement']
"Oh… Well, what about you?",['Open-ended']
What would you do?,['Open-ended']
If this was my last conversation?,['Confirmation']
"Yeah, I would tell you the same thing, that I love you.",['Statement']
Do you want to be cremated?,['Open-ended']
And where you want us to throw you?,['Open-ended']
"In the toilet, the garbage can?",['Closed-ended']
"No, not the garbage can.",['Statement']
"All that, it didn’t make no sense to get me cremated",['Statement']
"Okay, so sorry.",['Statement']
Just get me cremated and throw me out back?,['Confirmation']
"We could use some soil and, you know, plant a tree.",['Statement']
Oh yeah… That would be awesome.,['Statement']
"Something that can give fruit, you know.",['Statement']
That can give back.,['Statement']
" Yes, give it back.",['Statement']
"So for your great great grandchild listening to this years from now, is there any wisdom you want to pass on to them?",['Open-ended']
"You know, you don’t have to be religious to believe in something, ‘cause religion is what you do every day.",['Statement']
"And they got a song that say, ‘You don’t miss your water ‘til your well run dry.’",['Explain']
That’s why you’re supposed to treat people kind while they’re alive.,['Explain']
"And when your well dry, you want to see that person again.",['Statement']
But it’s all over.,['Statement']
"You know, we made do girl…",['Statement']
"Eventually, I’ve gotta go.",['Statement']
And I know it’s gonna break your heart.,['Statement']
I’ll be sad that I’m gone ‘cause I won’t have you to talk to.,['Statement']
But it’s gonna be alright.,['Statement']
"I’mma always be with you, here.",['Statement']
I looked different than everybody else.,['Statement']
"There was either white people or Black people, and there was me.",['Explain']
"And so, I stood out.",['Explain']
"And the cops would stop me sometimes, even as a young kid, they would stop me and go, ‘You know, you don’t belong in this neighborhood.’",['Explain']
"I was living in Rhode Island and Rhode Island School of Design had a, like, summer scholarships.",['Explain']
"So I entered the competition and the art teacher said, ‘They don’t want people like you.’",['Explain']
"And uh, I stopped drawing ever since then.",['Explain']
"It, it, it hurt.",['Statement']
How old were you?,['Open-ended']
I might’ve been 13.,['Statement']
"And I was, ‘I’m gonna prove them wrong. I need to go somewhere. I need more than this.’",['Explain']
And I went to New York.,['Statement']
"And I slept in hallways, and I slept in the subways, and I slept in Grand Central Station.",['Explain']
"I really couldn’t read and write very well, and, uh, when I did have jobs, I usually weren’t able to keep those jobs.",['Statement']
And then I learned to read and write by forcing myself to read an encyclopedia.,['Statement']
And I applied to go to an art school.,['Statement']
"I would like to hear more about how you built the confidence to pursue an artistic career, which I see as quite risky.",['Prompt']
"It was a little scary, but because Mommy did so much supporting us, it wasn’t as scary as if I was the only breadwinner.",['Explain']
And my joke was always that I did all the cooking and the sewing.,['Explain']
And Mommy did the brickwork and the plumbing.,['Explain']
"And when you girls were growing up, I made it a point that we would always have family meals on the weekend.",['Explain']
"And I wanted to raise my girls as really strong, powerful women.",['Explain']
"You girls would say, ‘I didn’t like when you raised your voice.’",['Explain']
And then I would learn to not be so tough on you.,['Explain']
"But you’re navigating the world very well, all of you.",['Explain']
"I’m 38, the age that you were when you had me.",['Statement']
What advice do you have for me?,['Open-ended']
The sad thing about human beings is that we tend to remember the unhappy things.,['Statement']
And I think my advice to you is just try to be happy.,['Statement']
The longest life is short.,['Statement']
"I would always say, ‘What can I do? As a parent, to make your life better?’",['Explain']
"Miranda Duschack and Mimo Davis’ have been farming together since 2012, supplying flowers in the St. Louis area.",['Statement']
At StoryCorps Miranda and Mimo told their own love story as the first lesbian couple married in Missouri.,['Statement']
We met at work.,['Statement']
Right.,['Statement']
At our day job.,['Statement']
"And then we decided to farm together…fell in love, got married, at a spiritual ceremony where we jumped the broom because we couldn’t legally be married.",['Explain']
And then the second wedding was in 2014 to be legally married.,['Explain']
Do you remember this?,['Open-ended']
When we had August.,['Statement']
"Do you remember how I pushed August out, ok…",['Open-ended']
"What do you mean, do I remember that?",['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Statement']
But they didn’t know how to fill out the birth certificate.,['Open-ended Declaration']
I do remember that.,['Statement']
"So, I was making a fact sheet to leave at the nurse’s station about how to register.",['Statement']
It’s okay.,['Statement']
"I just felt like we were total freaks, man.",['Statement']
"We weren’t freaks, we were just firsts.",['Statement']
We were just first.,['Statement']
And it was really embarrassing for me that we fought so hard to get married and then we got divorced.,['Explain']
"But, you know, that was part of the rights that we fought for.",['Statement']
I know.,['Statement']
"I mean, I would say that to people, You know, it…",['Statement']
"And that’s all part of the package, right?",['Confirmation']
You get to be married and then you get to be divorced.,['Statement']
I mean…,['Statement']
Right.,['Statement']
"I was like, just like straight people.",['Statement']
Just like straight people,['Statement']
Right.,['Statement']
I can get divorced.,['Statement']
I can get divorced.,['Statement']
It didn’t necessarily pan out the way we thought it would be…,['Explain']
But we’re still in it.,['Statement']
We’re still farming partners.,['Statement']
We’re raising a beautiful son.,['Statement']
These are gorgeous flowers sitting in front of us.,['Explain']
"And Mimo Davis, I’m going to say right now, I still really love you and care about you.",['Explain']
"Of course, of course, I love you and care about you too.",['Response']
I mean that was never in question for me.,['Statement']
"We are both really, in our hearts and souls and deep down, totally committed to each other, and that’s why we work through all the real stuff.",['Explain']
And I see that as a win.,['Statement']
It’s okay.,['Statement']
You can have you some tears.,['Statement']
"You and I would stay up till 12 o’clock at night, waiting to make that phone call to Pakistan, reminding them that we were inquiring about a child.",['Statement']
"And they would always say, ‘There’s no child for you.’",['Explain']
"You know, I’ve wanted to be a father since I was a little kid.",['Explain']
"And I think hearing those words night after night, it was sad.",['Explain']
"But, the moment they said, ‘We have a baby for you,’ I just remember this feeling of joy.",['Explain']
Seeing her for the first time and holding her was just the most gorgeous moment of my life.,['Explain']
"So, do you remember the day when you got your full diagnosis?",['Closed-ended']
"They called and they said, ‘You probably have a year to live.’",['Statement']
But It didn’t feel like all bad news.,['Statement']
"Like, think about the 40 years that God has given me.",['Statement']
What a beautiful life.,['Statement']
"But, Radiyya is always asking, ‘Are you better now?’",['Statement']
"You know, I say, ‘Abba is not going to get better.’",['Statement']
"And when she says, ‘But then I’ll cry and I’ll cry.’",['Explain']
"I remember saying to her, ‘Aap insaan ho. Ronaa theek hay.’",['Explain']
"You’re a human being, so it’s okay to cry, to be sad.",['Explain']
And you’ve told me that one of the hardest things you imagine is explaining to her where I am.,['Statement']
"Yeah, When she wakes up in the morning and she looks over to our bed and says, ‘Where’s Abba?’",['Explain']
And you’re in the bathroom.,['Explain']
I can’t but think about that moment when I’m going to have to answer that differently.,['Explain']
That’s going to be a hard one for me.,['Explain']
"You know, I feel a lot of sorrow in my heart thinking about that moment.",['Statement']
"But, even though I won’t be there physically, just know that I’ll be there spiritually.",['Statement']
You won’t be alone.,['Statement']
"So many people have said, ‘We’re praying for a miracle.’",['Explain']
But I always chuckle at that because I feel like my entire life has been a miracle.,['Explain']
And one of them is finding you.,['Explain']
"What you’ve done for me, waking up in the middle of the night, almost every night for the past three months, because I’m in pain.",['Explain']
"Those are the things that I hope Radiyya really knows, that that’s how you took care of me.",['Explain']
You know I’m just grateful for each moment that we get.,['Statement']
"My hope is that Radiyya will live life beautifully, no matter how long God gives her.",['Statement']
And you are especially going to teach her what it means to take life as a gift and to live it out every day.,['Statement']
Do you remember the first time you put on the uniform?,['Open-ended']
"I just felt like, oh, I’m a proud Marine, you know.",['Statement']
I thought I was something.,['Explain']
"I wanted to help fight for our country, and also show that we had the courage and intelligence to do so.",['Explain']
We knew we were the best.,['Statement']
Well we made it our business to be the best of the best.,['Explain']
Not mediocre but the best.,['Explain']
We’re going to hear now from Corporal Sidney Allen Francis.,['Statement']
"After serving as one of the first Black Marines… he worked as a New York City police detective… and in 2005 spoke with his daughter, Candice, at StoryCorps.",['Explain']
"I wanted to go into the Army, but they said no.",['Statement']
And this was World War II?,['Clarification']
Yeah.,['Statement']
"And they stamped my papers ‘Navy,’ and there was no way in the Hell I was going to the Navy.",['Statement']
Why didn’t you want to go in the Navy?,['Open-ended']
"I didn’t like the little hats they were in, the little …",['Statement']
"So then I said, ‘What about the Marine Corps?’",['Explain']
"The guy says, ‘Well, you have to go ‘round and see the Sergeant Major.’",['Explain']
First thing he said to me: ‘Are you a high school graduate?’,['Explain']
"I said, ‘Yes, sir.’ And I went to North Carolina for boot camp.",['Explain']
And what was that like?,['Open-ended']
"I mean, they were rough.",['Statement']
"Now, were your drill instructors, were they white or Black?",['Closed-ended']
"No, they were Black.",['Statement']
"But see, they had trained under white instructors because up to 1942, the Marine Corps had no Blacks.",['Explain']
And that’s why they were extra tough on us.,['Explain']
They wanted us to make it.,['Explain']
"And, uh, we did.",['Explain']
"Well, I have to tell you, I once went to jail down there.",['Explain']
"I was with my buddy from New York, he was in the Marine Corps, and we were going to Raleigh from Montford Point.",['Explain']
And we’re sitting in the back of the bus.,['Explain']
"Then the bus stopped to pick up people, and the bus driver came up and he said, uh, ‘You guys will have to get up.’",['Explain']
"I said, ‘Get up for what?’",['Statement']
"He says, ‘These white people have to sit down.’",['Explain']
"I said, ‘We’re in the back of the bus.’",['Explain']
"He said, ‘You ought to get up.’",['Statement']
And I lost my head then.,['Explain']
"I says, ‘We’re not getting up.’",['Statement']
"And lo and behold, in not even 10 minutes, in comes police with guns drawn.",['Explain']
And they took me that night to some little prison camp.,['Explain']
"And in the morning I heard, ‘Warden, this is Major Pauper, United States Marine Corps. You got one of my boys in there.’",['Explain']
"All the Marines from Montford Point, they were on six by six trucks with machine guns at the ready.",['Explain']
You could see they just wanted to tear that jail down.,['Explain']
"And when I came out, Major Pauper, he says, ‘PFC Francis, you get on that truck. We’re out of here.’",['Explain']
"And he hollered it back, ‘Thank you, Warden, that you didn’t hurt one of my Marines.’",['Explain']
"He said, ‘You would have been in trouble.’",['Explain']
"That was Sidney Allen Francis speaking with his daughter, Candice.",['Statement']
"Sidney died February 15, 2014.",['Explain']
His daughter recently came back to StoryCorps,['Explain']
So I didn’t know that story before.,['Statement']
"He had never shared that with me, but it sounded like my father.",['Explain']
I wasn’t surprised by that at all.,['Statement']
"You know, a lot of Black men who served this country had to also suffer indignities, even while in uniform.",['Explain']
I don’t think that they’ve gotten the credit that they deserve for putting their lives in danger.,['Explain']
"And coming out of it with scars that didn’t come from the so-called enemy, but came from within.",['Explain']
But what I appreciate about my father is that he used his military service to give him what he needed to build a life for himself and his family.,['Explain']
"It gave him purpose, and it gave him an anchor …",['Explain']
And I’m grateful for that.,['Statement']
So what do you want your grandchildren to know about you?,['Open-ended']
"I want them to just remember that I loved them, that’s all.",['Statement']
There’s nothing exciting about me.,['Statement']
I’m just a man.,['Statement']
Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…,['Statement']
"When I was seventeen, I got pregnant.",['Statement']
And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.,['Explain']
I just wasn’t ready for that.,['Statement']
I’m sure.,['Statement']
I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.,['Statement']
That’s something I can’t make better for you.,['Explain']
And I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but… you’ll be okay…,['Explain']
They came back in 2023.,['Statement']
"At 88, Jackie’s health was declining…",['Explain']
Realizing his mom was nearing the end of life…,['Explain']
Scott wanted to do one more interview…,['Explain']
I cannot believe 15 years have passed.,['Statement']
I don’t have any more revelations to unleash on you.,['Statement']
And now I have an old person’s voice.,['Statement']
It cracks…,['Explain']
But I still don’t think of myself as old.,['Statement']
"I mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back.",['Explain']
But that doesn’t keep me from doing it.,['Explain']
"The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot.",['Explain']
"He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.",['Explain']
But my world is really getting smaller.,['Statement']
Words don’t come that easily to me now.,['Explain']
It’s really scary.,['Explain']
"The other day, I couldn’t remember my cell phone number.",['Explain']
"I recognize this is part of getting not older but old, you know?",['Open-ended']
" Yeah… You know in our first interview I had said, uh… it scares me imagining life without you, and it doesn’t so much scare me anymore.",['Statement']
"But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it.",['Explain']
"You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.",['Explain']
So when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone…,['Explain']
"It feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice.",['Explain']
"One of the things every parent wants to know is just, how happy are you with your life?",['Open-ended']
I’m very happy about my life.,['Response']
"I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.",['Explain']
I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you…,['Statement']
There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that.,['Explain']
"You can have great friends or loved ones, but it’s not the same.",['Explain']
As you’ve heard… StoryCorps has always been about chasing big ideas.,['Statement']
And one of those big ideas is that every single person in the country would one day be able to record an interview.,['Explain']
"But during our first ten years, if someone wanted to record, they’d have to come to one of our booths in person.",['Explain']
"In 2015, that all changed…",['Statement']
"That year, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay went on stage to give a TED Talk.",['Explain']
"Tonight, I’m going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person’s life, and in yours…",['Statement']
Dave had won the TED Prize….,['Statement']
And that night he was on stage to reveal a brand new idea.,['Explain']
"Here is my wish: that you will help us take everything we’ve learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world, so that anyone can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history.",['Request']
"Over the past couple of months, the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths, so that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime.",['Statement']
"Together we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity, and maybe in doing so, we’ll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less.",['Statement']
Maybe these conversations will remind us what is really important.,['Explain']
"And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infinitely.",['Explain']
Thank you very much.,['Statement']
"And just like that, one of the largest barriers to participating in StoryCorps was gone.",['Statement']
"Grandpa, tell me about your parents…",['Prompt']
What was your first impression when you came to America?,['Open-ended']
Can you share one of the happiest memories in your lifetime?,['Open-ended']
Tell me what you were like as a child and how did you like to spend your time…,['Prompt']
"My advice is don’t grow up, it’s a trap!",['Statement']
In this episode… stories from beyond the recording booth…,['Statement']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Statement']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Statement']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Statement']
"A few months after the app came out, there was a perfect opportunity to get people to use it… Thanksgiving – a holiday known for putting family members in the same room.",['Statement']
So that year… we asked people to use the app when they went home for the holidays.,['Explain']
We called it the Great Thanksgiving Listen… and it’s actually become a once-a-year tradition.,['Explain']
"The hope was that we could get enough people to interview each other… that we’d document an entire generation in one day… like we said, big ideas.",['Explain']
"Anyway, the interviews started coming in… from people’s kitchens, hotel rooms… and even one from inside a parked car at a strip mall in Iowa…",['Explain']
We asked that person who recorded that one  to walk us through that experience…,['Explain']
Hi my name is Kara Masteller and I interviewed my grandfather in my 1994 Buick.,['Statement']
"Well, she was a good looker.",['Response']
We fit together.,['Explain']
We were a good pair.,['Explain']
"My grandma, everyone referred to her as like a spicy meatball.",['Statement']
"She swore a lot, but she looked so innocent that no one ever expected her to say the things that she said.",['Explain']
Were you nervous to propose to her?,['Closed-ended']
"We had something to say, we said it.",['Explain']
What are the keys to a happy marriage?,['Open-ended']
"Well if something happens just say, ‘I’m sorry’ and get it over with.",['Statement']
There’s no reason to carry on.,['Explain']
"I just say ‘I’m sorry. I love ya,’ and that was the whole story.",['Explain']
I was really surprised by my grandpa saying sorry.,['Statement']
I’ve never heard him say sorry.,['Explain']
How would you like to be remembered?,['Open-ended']
Remem—?,['Confirmation']
Do you want to be remembered as like a real tough guy?,['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, I was a pretty soft guy.",['Response']
You intimidated me when I was little.,['Statement']
I did?,['Confirmation']
You did.,['Statement']
Are you happy about the life you’ve lived?,['Open-ended']
It wasn’t the easiest life back in them days.,['Statement']
Mother died when I was four.,['Explain']
And it was a tough life.,['Explain']
He tells one story about how he was eight or nine and he was ice skating on the river and he fell through.,['Statement']
He didn’t have hot water wherever he was living with his dad.,['Explain']
So he broke into the school and just took a hot shower in the school.,['Explain']
I think that says a lot about his childhood that there was really no one there to help him get out of the water or keep him warm.,['Explain']
"Last April he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and I had never really heard him say much about it.",['Statement']
What do you think about Alzheimer’s?,['Open-ended']
Not much you can do.,['Statement']
I even can’t remember some names now myself.,['Explain']
So maybe I have got it.,['Statement']
"And when he said, ‘I don’t know what it would be like to have it.’",['Statement']
That was difficult for me.,['Statement']
"So then I had to ask a follow-up just out of, I don’t know, self-preservation because I thought I was gonna cry.",['Explain']
"As people age, do you have any advice for them as they get older?",['Open-ended']
It’s coming.,['Statement']
Don’t fight it.,['Order']
Just roll with.,['Order']
I mean real life.,['Explain']
Live it.,['Order']
It’s wonderful.,['Statement']
After the interview my grandpa and I talked a lot more.,['Statement']
"The last thing he said \n(laughs) before we got out of the car was, ‘Let’s give ‘em hell kiddo.’",['Explain']
That’s Kara Masteller with her grandfather James Kennicott from her 1994 Buick in an Iowa parking lot…,['Statement']
"Before this… StoryCorps typically had been recording about 7,000 interviews a year.",['Explain']
"But with the app… on the Sunday after Thanksgiving… 17,000 interviews were added to the archive.",['Explain']
The app made it possible for people to record even if their hometown wasn’t a stop on the StoryCorps tour… which is important… because some conversations can’t wait. Dave Isay knew that first hand… ,['Explain']
"Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad.",['Statement']
"I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago, when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health, was diagnosed with cancer.",['Explain']
He passed away very suddenly a few days later.,['Statement']
I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died.,['Explain']
"I have a couple of young kids at home, and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session.",['Explain']
"I thought I couldn’t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did, but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.",['Explain']
"Every day, people come up to me and say, ”I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother, but I waited too long.”",['Explain']
"Now, no one has to wait anymore.",['Explain']
"And we saw people using the app in this way, like Eva Vega-Olds…",['Statement']
"In 2015, her father Leonardo was diagnosed with lung cancer.",['Explain']
After going through chemo unsuccessfully… he went into hospice care at his home in New Jersey.,['Explain']
And Eva used the app to preserve his voice…,['Explain']
"When I was recording my dad, I was in his bedroom that he shared with my mom.",['Explain']
"There was the hospital bed in there, he had an oxygen machine, and he was struggling to breath, but I said, “Dad, do you want to do an interview?”",['Explain']
"Daddy, where were you born?",['Confirmation']
Puerto Rico.,['Statement']
And do you know how long you’ve been in New Jersey?,['Closed-ended']
Sixty-five years.,['Statement']
I’ve been here all my life.,['Statement']
"He was a factory worker, worked the graveyard shift, you know so he’s leaving for work when we’re coming back from school.",['Explain']
"And then later on, he was a custodian and he was always working.",['Explain']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Open-ended']
I don’t know…,['Statement']
"Well I plan on telling the kids that you were really loyal, a committed father… funny…",['Promise']
"My family’s the kind of family that if you can’t take sarcasm, forget about it.",['Statement']
"Like my wedding day, I remember walking down the aisle, and my dad was walking like super slow.",['Explain']
"And I’m like, “Dad!”",['Explain']
"And he says to me, “Shhh, it’s my day. I finally get rid of you.”",['Explain']
Do you remember teaching me how to swim?,['Closed-ended']
I remember you throwing me in the water and I was screaming and crying like I was gonna drown.,['Statement']
"And I was like, “No, I can’t swim!” And then you yelled at me, “Well then just stand up”",['Explain']
Do you remember that?,['Closed-ended']
"When we took him home, he came back to hospice care and the nurses were there.",['Statement']
"He looked at me and he said, “I think they think I’m gonna die.”",['Explain']
"And I said, “Well, if you feel differently then do differently.”",['Explain']
But every day he got weaker and closer to the end.,['Explain']
Do you think you’re dying?,['Open-ended']
Everybody dies.,['Statement']
"Up until that moment, we had not talked about him dying.",['Statement']
Are you afraid?,['Closed-ended']
I wish it wasn’t happening right now.,['Statement']
What are you most proud of Daddy?,['Open-ended']
My kids.,['Response']
Your kids?,['Confirmation']
My family.,['Response']
I did the interview Tuesday afternoon and he passed on Thursday night.,['Statement']
"You know, not for nothing but my dad’s a working class fellow, he bought a home, paid off his home, and was able to die in his home, with his family around him.",['Explain']
"For him, that was the pinnacle of what your life should be. And I think that he did achieve his dreams.",['Explain']
Coming up after the break…,['Statement']
"StoryCorps’ whole business model, if you will, is getting two people together in an enclosed space to talk right at each other, which, you know, when there’s a global respiratory pandemic is, you know, not great.",['Statement']
Stay with us…,['Order']
When the entire world came to a halt in March of 2020… so did StoryCorps…,['Statement']
"We all were kind of like, what the heck do we do?",['Open-ended']
"That’s Martin Olson, the director of digital at StoryCorps – he’s the guy behind the scenes who keeps things like our app and the archive running.",['Explain']
And in the early days of Covid… when suddenly no one could sit down together for an interview anymore… he had to kind of figure out how to keep StoryCorps itself running.,['Explain']
"I remember we were still at the StoryCorps offices and Dave just came by and, sort of, started chatting.",['Explain']
"He was just like, “Can we do anything remote?”",['Explain']
"And, you know, obviously looking a little bit panicked.",['Explain']
"Like, How can we actually do something that helps bring people together in this crazy moment?",['Rhetorical']
"I had actually been messing around a little bit with remote recording, and, at that point, Zoom had entered people’s lives very quickly.",['Explain']
"You know, here we come, a non-profit with a two person digital team and we’re like, “Cool, we’re going to build a thing. Trust us, it’ll work.”",['Explain']
And just like that…another “big idea” was born…,['Statement']
And I remember over a weekend basically sat down and banged together like a little basic prototype.,['Statement']
Two people with browsers can see each other; they can talk to each other.,['Explain']
We can record this audio and then we can get that to talk to our archive.,['Explain']
"You know, that weekend where you sat down to just be like, I gotta build this thing?",['Confirmation']
"I mean, are you hunched over your computer til three in the morning, like, how are you doing this?",['Open-ended']
"Yeah, I guess coffee is an occupational hazard of being both a computer nerd and Swedish–actually my son’s first word was kaffe, which is, uh, coffee in Swedish.",['Statement']
"So thankfully that kept me going, but honestly it was a little bit sort of piece by piece, right?",['Confirmation']
"It’s like, alright well, Okay so I’ve got one window and I can see myself in that one and I can see myself in this one.",['Explain']
"Okay, so they need to hit a record button.",['Statement']
Alright so we’ll add that,['Statement']
Did it work?,['Rhetorical']
Crap it didn’t work.,['Statement']
"Alright, doop, doop, doop…Try a thing.",['Explain']
You realize that you forgot a semicolon somewhere because it’s two in the morning.,['Explain']
"It’s a little bit of just sort of trying your way forward sometimes, until you sort of look up and you’re like oh, I should probably go to bed or I’m gonna be a little groggy tomorrow. ",['Explain']
"So was all of this exciting for you as, like, a nerdy tech guy?",['Confirmation']
Or was it terrifying?,['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, I resent the premise of the question as a nerdy tech guy, but…",['Statement']
"Hey, I’m using your words.",['Statement']
As a highly socially competent tech guy.,['Explain']
"I don’t remember a moment where I kinda walked in and it was like, you know, Shark Tank and I was like, “Dave, here’s my prototype.”",['Explain']
"I think it was more like, “look I put this thing together; it seems like this is a thing we can do.”",['Explain']
Next thing I know it’s got a name called StoryCorps Connect.,['Explain']
"They’re like, “When can we get this thing done?”",['Explain']
You’ve got 48 hours…,['Statement']
It was a lot faster than you’d really wanna do this kind of thing.,['Statement']
But it was not like a single ‘just me’ effort. ,['Explain']
There was a lot of different people involved.,['Explain']
"At the time I also worked with another great guy named Steven on our technology team, so a lot of the early interviews are he and I testing internally.",['Explain']
"Yeah, so this is a recording from my phone.",['Statement']
And I guess the real question is how is this going to come out on the other side.,['Explain']
Will it come out at all?,['Closed-ended']
Let’s see what happens.,['Statement']
We’ve gotta see if this thing records so I’ve gotta sit there and just record myself I guess.,['Statement']
"And so there’s a lot of me just like doo doo doo doo doo, you know,  into the thing and like…",['Explain']
"Before we released it more widely, we actually have a whole raft of interviews that were staff members calling family members.",['Statement']
And this includes you…,['Statement']
So I’ve got one with my sister.,['Explain']
"So hey, how’s it going?",['Open-ended']
"It’s going alright, how are you?",['Open-ended']
"Ah you know, stressing out.",['Statement']
"Because this thing tomorrow, in theory, this thing is going to go live and I basically built it in two weeks",['Explain']
Are we testing it?,['Closed-ended']
"Yeah, we’re testing it.",['Response']
After lots of testing and fixing StoryCorps Connect on the fly… we opened it up to the public…and… people started to use it.,['Statement']
When did you realize COVID-19 was serious?,['Closed-ended']
My anxiety levels are always on 10.,['Statement']
"I pray on my way to work, I pray on my lunch break.",['Explain']
What keeps me going is the fact that I need to keep goin.,['Explain']
I fear whenever I leave the house.,['Statement']
"Everyday I wake up and just wonder, ’Is this the day that COVID-19 is gonna come home with me?’",['Open-ended']
"I’ve lost several people over these last couple months that I wasn’t able to say goodbye to, and so that has been really hard.",['Statement']
One of the things I miss most is giving you a hug.,['Statement']
"And uh, when this is all over it’s, uh, one of the things I wanna do.",['Statement']
"I remember we had this feeling like, you know, this is this important moment, not only do we need to be here to, you know, help people connect, but also, you know, to document this moment when all of a sudden people found themselves in this new alien world, right?",['Confirmation']
"This new world was scary, unknown, and lonely…because the only thing worse than not seeing loved ones… was the possibility of exposing them to the virus…",['Statement']
"Dr. Roberto Vargas was the Director of Microbiology at a hospital in Rochester, New York.",['Statement']
When the pandemic hit he found himself working long hours in the lab… running countless COVID tests.,['Explain']
Because of the risk… and for the sake of his wife and four kids… he started living in a hotel near his lab… and then later in the basement of their house.,['Explain']
"That’s where he was for this StoryCorps Connect recording… with his wife, Susan, and their 10-year-old son, Xavier, directly upstairs from him… but speaking through their computers.",['Explain']
"When I would go to the hotel room after a long day and it was just me there, and it was very quiet; that was when I missed you all the most.",['Explain']
"It got very worrying once I knew the virus was going to be, like, a big thing, and with you gone it was way harder.",['Explain']
I just missed you.,['Statement']
"I remember you’d dropped groceries off and put them on the front porch, and that’s when we started talking through the window next to our front door.",['Explain']
"You would talk on your cell phone, and the kids and I would sit behind the window.",['Explain']
"And I remember one of the hardest nights, I think you were just exhausted, you just had your head on the window and were crying.",['Explain']
"But eventually, you started sleeping in the basement.",['Statement']
And I would not let the kids go past the top of the basement stairs.,['Statement']
"We had to stay far away but I just felt better that you could be, like, a part of us.",['Statement']
"It’s still very hard but it’s just nice to see you, Dad.",['Open-ended Declaration']
"You have been so helpful to mom, so thank you, ok? ",['Statement']
"I remember, once you came into the basement, the best night I had yet, you know, your coworker had made all these different dishes for us.",['Explain']
"You sat at the bottom of the stairs in a rocking chair, and I was at the top.",['Explain']
"I remember that, yes.",['Statement']
 I even remember the food; it smelled so good.,['Explain']
"It was the first time we had been able to connect in so long and, as crazy as it sounds, it’s the best date I’ve ever had with you in my life. ",['Explain']
"Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to do what I’ve been able to do at work.",['Statement']
You have to be absolutely everything to our four beautiful kids.,['Explain']
I’ve never loved you more and I know it hasn’t been easy.,['Explain']
"Can you guys try not to cry, it makes me sad when you cry.",['Request']
These are tears of happiness.,['Statement']
"Roberto, I admire you so much–always admired you–but you’ve done things these \npast couple months that seem impossible.",['Statement']
"What you’re doing is a lot harder than what I’m doing, a lot harder.",['Explain']
"Dad, I just want to say thank you for helping get rid of this virus.",['Open-ended Declaration']
That’s a team effort and that team includes you.,['Statement']
But what carries me through is this family.,['Explain']
"StoryCorps was always really about people talking to each other and looking back, sort of saying, like, where did you grow up?",['Open-ended']
How did you get to this place?,['Open-ended']
"During that time though we actually have so much of people just connecting with each other and saying, like, so how has this been for you?",['Open-ended']
How is this currently going?,['Open-ended']
"These basic realities of, like, figuring out how to be around each other, how to find toilet paper, you know, which, remember that? ",['Open-ended']
That was fun.,['Statement']
"At this point, it’s been more than half a year that we’ve been living in isolation… and then Thanksgiving comes along… a holiday where we’re all supposed to get together.",['Statement']
"So once again, the question was… what do we do?",['Open-ended']
"There was an older story from before the pandemic…about a vacuum repair guy from Melrose, Massachusetts named Scott MacCaulay… and he hosts Thanksgiving dinner for strangers.",['Statement']
We thought maybe he’d have the answer…Here’s his original story from 2010…,['Explain']
My folks decided to get divorced.,['Statement']
"And if you were nice to one, the other one would get mad with you.",['Explain']
"When October came, I thought, gee, you know, what’s going to happen at Thanksgiving?",['Explain']
"So I just thought, well, there must be some other people that are in the same boat.",['Statement']
Why should they have that rotten feeling?,['Open-ended']
Why should they be stuck home alone?,['Open-ended']
"So, I put an ad in the local paper and offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner for twelve people.",['Statement']
People came and they had a good time.,['Statement']
"And, last year 84 people showed up.",['Statement']
What I do is transform the hall at the First Baptist Church to look as close to home as I can get it.,['Explain']
I have a fake fireplace.,['Statement']
I have Norman Rockwell’s famous Thanksgiving picture framed.,['Explain']
And the way I test my success or failure is how long they stay.,['Explain']
"Last year, I had a family show up two hours late.",['Statement']
He had lost his job and they had heard about the dinner and wanted something to eat.,['Explain']
"And, some of these people might not have anything, but they always find something that they can be grateful for.",['Explain']
"My goal is always to have nobody sign up, ’cause that means everybody’s got a place to go and everybody’s okay.",['Explain']
And that’s what keeps me going twenty-five years later.,['Explain']
So in 2020…we reached back out to Scott to see how he was dealing with this new reality.,['Statement']
"Well, turns out…instead of hosting an in-person event… Scott partnered with a local restaurant to give away free meals from the window of his vacuum repair shop.",['Statement']
"Using StoryCorps Connect, Scott spoke with his friend Loretta Saint-Louis, who he met during one of his dinners.",['Statement']
I was new to Melrose and I didn’t really know people here.,['Statement']
And I saw the advertisement.,['Explain']
I think it was in the paper.,['Explain']
And it took a bit of courage for me to just call you.,['Explain']
What was your first impression of this crazy guy on the other end of the phone?,['Open-ended']
You were so friendly.,['Statement']
"I was blown away, all the care that you put into it.",['Explain']
It felt like I was going to a family Thanksgiving event.,['Explain']
And I’m going to miss that a lot.,['Explain']
"Yeah, because of the COVID-19 crisis.",['Explain']
I’ve offered people alternatives to us getting together.,['Explain']
"It’s nice to know that you still want to feed us, but it’s the togetherness of it that’s important.",['Statement']
"You know, all the people that come …they are young and old, male, female from different places, backgrounds, and countries.",['Statement']
"And what I find always interesting is despite the great differences, they all have similar things that they’re thankful for.",['Explain']
And some of them will make you cry.,['Explain']
Somebody will say their son’s now speaking to them.,['Explain']
"You know, no matter what your condition is, health-wise, financial, or newly divorced, or newly widowed, they focus for some time on good things.",['Explain']
And I think that’s \nwonderful.,['Statement']
What advice do you have for people who will be alone this year?,['Open-ended']
"I would say call everybody and anybody that you can think of tell them, “I love you.”",['Statement']
"Don’t talk with your mouth full, you know, we don’t want spraying turkey all over the computer screen or the phone.",['Warning']
But connect with as many people that you think might be alone or would appreciate a call and tell them you’re thinking of them.,['Order']
"My philosophy is: I can’t fix the country or the world or even the town, but I can brighten my own corner.",['Explain']
"It doesn’t matter what any of the differences that we can divide ourselves with, if your neighbor’s house is burning down, you run to put the fire out.",['Explain']
"I’m not going to sit around, talk about it.",['Explain']
I’m just going to do something about it.,['Explain']
And that’s sort of what the Thanksgiving dinner is all about.,['Explain']
"That would be my hope for America, that everybody would just brighten the corner where they are.",['Explain']
"We checked in with Scott again this year, and he’s still running those takeaway dinners. Last year, he served 100 people.",['Statement']
It was just a weird weird time.,['Statement']
"You know, and… It is so bananas to think back to it now.",['Explain']
"But I really do think that it generally felt, just, good to do something.",['Explain']
And I’m the first person to say that technology is not the solution to a lot of problems.,['Explain']
"But it is nice when there is something where, like, you can think of a way to do something that just wouldn’t be possible otherwise.",['Explain']
"And, again, hopefully, if you’ve done your job right, the technology somewhat melts away, and it’s just communication. It’s just people.",['Explain']
And it continues today.,['Statement']
"It’s still what we use to record, you know, a lot of interviews.",['Statement']
And it’s really opened us up to connect people who have something to say to each other but they’re not in the same place.,['Explain']
"I always used to joke with people that whenever there’s a zombie apocalypse, right, I’m not going to be much use because a lot of my skills have to do with plugging things together and, like, electronics and computers.",['Explain']
"But in this case, all these computer nerdy skills actually came in handy when it had to actually wire things together.",['Explain']
"So you know, that was nice.",['Explain']

Joseph Rogers Britton has spent 40 years caring for others.,['Statement']
" In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV.",['Statement']
And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Statement']
You know what the biggest joy was?,['Rhetorical']
That just made my week.,['Statement']
During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Statement']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Explain']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work. Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV.",['Statement']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Explain']
"We missed every single dinner date, every movie.",['Explain']
And that led into a thirty year relationship.,['Explain']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Explain']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses. ",['Explain']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Statement']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Response']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Explain']
And it’s not the glitz.,['Explain']
It’s the simple touches.,['Explain']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence.",['Statement']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV.,['Statement']
I can guarantee it.,['Response']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Explain']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother.",['Statement']
And we’d leave bouquets of roses at their door.,['Statement']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Statement']
"Over the last year, Mary Johnson-Roy has been getting a steady stream of visitors… all there to basically say one thing",['Statement']
"Thank you, Mary. I love you.",['Open-ended Declaration']

"I love you, sister Mary.",['Response']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Open-ended Declaration']
Mary lives in Minneapolis.,['Statement']
And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide.,['Statement']
" If it wasn’t for Mary, I don’t know where I would be as a grieving mother.",['Explain']
"Mary’s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.",['Statement']
But there’s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work…,['Explain']
Her connection to the man who killed her son…,['Explain']
My name is Mary Johnson.,['Statement']
I am Oshea Israel.,['Statement']
My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I’m her second son.,['Statement']

I’m Jasmyn Morris…,['Statement']
 And I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Statement']
This week… a story you have to hear to believe.,['Statement']
"Let’s start at the beginning… in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis…",['Statement']
"My son, Laramiun, was intelligent.",['Statement']
Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level.,['Explain']
"He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy.",['Explain']
"He grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.",['Explain']
"He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that’s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.",['Explain']
"One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time.",['Explain']
They got into a fight… and Oshea shot and killed him.,['Explain']
Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.,['Statement']
"And over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son.",['Statement']
And after a decade of trying to find peace… she decided to try something different… to visit Oshea in prison.,['Explain']
"I’m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.",['Explain']
"That’s Regina Irwin, one of Mary’s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day…",['Explain']
"And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom.",['Statement']
And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink.,['Statement']
We’ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next.,['Order']
You and I met at Stillwater Prison.,['Statement']
But you were not that 16-year-old.,['Explain']
You were a grown man.,['Explain']
I shared with you about my son.,['Statement']

This episode was produced by Jasmyn Morris and Jud Esty-Kendall.,['Statement']
Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd. ,['Statement']
"And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can– just hug you like I would my own mother, you know.",['Explain']
"And I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you– I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you.",['Explain']
I treat you as I would treat my son.,['Explain']
And our relationship is beyond belief.,['Explain']
We live next door to one another.,['Explain']
 I find those things funny because it’s a relationship with a mother for real.,['Explain']
I didn’t see him graduate.,['Statement']
Now you’re going to college.,['Explain']
I’ll have the opportunity to see you graduate.,['Explain']
I didn’t see him getting married.,['Explain']
"Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to experience that with you.",['Explain']
Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation.,['Statement']
It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.,['Explain']

"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.",['Explain']
"It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy.",['Explain']

"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14.",['Explain']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Explain']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters.,['Explain']

"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Explain']

"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now – celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Statement']
That clip youjust  heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US… that’s from an initiative called One Small Step.,['Statement']
That’s Mary Bess Ser…. she works on One Small Step.,['Statement']
We just want people to talk. ,['Request']
One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.,['Statement']
One of the keys is that phrase “very specific circumstances” – so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.,['Explain']
Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other… but One Small Step interviews are between strangers. ,['Statement']
The fact that they’re strangers really makes it less threatening.,['Statement']
So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother – that may or may not be my story –  it’s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there’s no relationship at stake.,['Explain']
"They can select from a list of terms to identify themselves… things like parent, grandparent or veteran.",['Explain']
And they write a short bio… describing themselves in their own words – and that gets shared with their interview partner.,['Explain']
Then someone from StoryCorps – like Mary Bess – matches them up with a stranger.,['Explain']
Mm-hmm.,['Response']
What did you think?,['Open-ended']
"Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype—",['Response']
"I mean, that really is something, right?",['Confirmation']
"Here’s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona.",['Statement']
Their connection… was parenting.,['Statement']
So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?,['Open-ended']
That’s a great question.,['Response']
Who knew how that was going to go?,['Open-ended']
"We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right?",['Confirmation']
It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right?,['Confirmation']
Right.,['Response']
"No, never have.",['Response']
What do you do for a living?,['Open-ended']
"Believe it or not, I’m a toilet paper salesman",['Response']
Really?,['Confirmation']
Two ply?,['Clarification']
"Two ply, wipe it up, yeah. I’ve been there 40 years.",['Response']
Is that right?,['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Response']
You know what?,['Open-ended']
People have come to believe that these conversations are possible.,['Statement']
Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory?,['Confirmation']
Yeah.,['Response']
"Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step",['Response']
"When they spoke in 2003… Sandy’s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before.",['Statement']
Birdie was the love of your life?,['Clarification']
"Oh yeah, yeah.",['Response']
What did you love about her?,['Open-ended']
Or is it not?,['Closed-ended']
Is it damaging to bring up? ,['Closed-ended']
