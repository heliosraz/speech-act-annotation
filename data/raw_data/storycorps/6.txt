Von Diaz: In 2024 NASA decommissioned the Ingenuity Helicopter, the first man-made craft to fly on another planet.
Loay Elbasyouni is a Palestinian American engineer who was part of the team that designed it. 
In 2021 he recorded a StoryCorps Virtual interview with his brother Heissam, about growing up in Gaza, and the moment the copter first took flight.
Loay Elbasyouni (LE): I was at home watching the live feed on the NASA TV. And then they said, “lift off, three feet. Five feet.” It worked. It flew. We made history. 
I feel like I’m part of the Wright Brother team, like, who flew the first time on Earth. Maybe I always was an engineer. You remember our uncle, he’d be like, “Oh I think you should study engineering.” Cause I fixed his radio. Do you remember, like, We created our own TV?
HE: Yeah, yeah right.
LE:  I plug in the Atari into the antenna backwards and then start broadcasting the Atari game over channel three. And then everybody in the neighborhood started watching us playing Atari. [Laughs] Trial and error gets you a long way.
Heissam Elbasyouni (HE): What was the hardest thing to get used to when uh you moved to the United States? 
LE: Hmmm not seeing family. It was really difficult, you know? To be all separated. I guess we never predicted that we cannot go back. But then the situation got really bad back home. Hell, I mean, it’s been 21 years now.
It’s easier to go to Mars than go to Gaza. Cause going to Mars you can calculate everything. It’s all based on science and knowledge. Where going to Gaza, like, the border is always closed, you couldn’t get out. And sometimes I don’t understand why things the way they are. Why would it be so hard?
