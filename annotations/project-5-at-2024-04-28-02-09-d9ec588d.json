And they would see me again around Christmas time. And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again. So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable. And as far as you doing the business? You started younger than me.\nPMJ: As soon as I could walk.\nPM: Even before you were walking.\nPMJ: Yeah, I…\nPM: I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.\nPMJ: I was literally there since day one. I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.” Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.\nPM: I have a sense of usefulness. And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.\nPMJ: I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…\nPM: That comes from coming from immigrant parents. You can never work hard enough. Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.” Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?\nPMJ: Never.\nPM: When do I ever take vacations?\nPMJ: No, never.\nPM: And when am I gonna retire?\nPMJ: One day before your funeral? PM: You know it.\nPMJ: Yup. [Laughter]\nPM: You know if you ever didn’t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken. I would understand.\nPMJ: Yeah, yeah.\nPM: You know what I mean? My father, he hated my business man. You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time. But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.” I like that.\nPMJ: You raised all of us, man. Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man. That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.\nPM: Well you do your best kid. This is what you do. But honestly your best. Not just your B.S. best. And even if you fail. It doesn’t feel that bad.\nPMJ: You’re always my barometer. You never let anyone down.

Yes [laughs]\nVon Diaz:  Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego.\nThey see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.\nHe came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.\nPR: My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.  \nPR: What’s your earliest memory, Rob? \nRR: I rolled my Uncle Charlie’s Dodge into the street light. \nPR: Wait, what happened?-\nRR: Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.\nPR: Into a telephone pole? \nRR: Yes. [laughs] \nPR: Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled. He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.  \nPR: Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,\nRR: Yeah, I fell out. \nPR: Yeah? And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving? \nRR: No, the locks were defected. \nPR: So you weren’t playing with the door handle? \nRR: No. I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.\nPR: I know you had trouble with the locks  [laughs]\nRR: And then another time I bit a horse. \nPR: No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob. \nRR: I thought I did? [Laughs]\nPR: The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.” [laughs]\nPR: Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years. Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping. And he got to know nearly every resident. He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people. In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors. And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?” He just has that sense of what’s right. \nPR: What’s your happiest memory? \nRR: Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim. But my dad’s a little excitable. \nPR: [laughs] Why do you think that is, Rob? \nRR: I think that’s his nature. \nPR: Yeah? Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things? \nRR: No no, that’s his nature. \nPR: Rolling cars into trees? \nRR: I don’t do that anymore. \nPR: Oh okay [laughs]\nPR: I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?” \nBecause he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor.

The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.  It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy. \n \nBut it was our place. You know, it was beautiful. \n \nTypical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically? But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk… Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something. ‘Should I tell my parents? Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’ \n \nThe suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that. I had a few of those calls. ‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’ That’s all we could say, really.\n \nBut I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.\n \nMy family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic. Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14. And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him. And my mother? She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.\n  \nShe felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters. So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore. You know, and I was still like just a kid.\n \nIt would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted. But that wasn’t who I was. \n \nThe impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.\n \nThat’s what people wanted to hear. They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you. You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone. \n\nClose"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-14T15:11:50.389331Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T16:01:29.633893Z","inner_id":6,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":204,"annotations":[{"id":204,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":45,"end":198,"text":"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you.

He’s created designs for brands like Cartier <<CAR-tee-yay>>.\nHe belongs to the Narragansett tribe. Growing up, he moved between foster homes in Rhode Island and Virginia.  \nAnd as he told his daughter Xiao Hui Star <<shah-way-star>>, he was often one of the few Indigenous people in town.\nTranscript TRT: [3:18]\n \nTchin (T) and Xiao Hui Star (XS)\nT: I looked different than everybody else. There was either white people or Black people, and there was me. And so, I stood out. And the cops would stop me sometimes, even as a young kid, they would stop me and go, ‘You know, you don’t belong in this neighborhood.’\nI was living in Rhode Island and Rhode Island School of Design had a, like, summer scholarships. So I entered the competition and the art teacher said, ‘They don’t want people like you.’ And uh, I stopped drawing ever since then. \nXS: Wow. \nT: Yeah. It, it, it hurt. \nXS: How old were you?\nT: I might’ve been 13. \nXS: Hmm. \nT: And, uh, people would say, like, ‘You know, you’re gonna end up in jail,’ or, ‘You’re not gonna ever become anything’ or anything like that. And I was, ‘I’m gonna prove them wrong. I need to go somewhere. I need more than this.’ And I went to New York. And I slept in hallways, and I slept in the subways, and I slept in Grand Central Station.\nI really couldn’t read and write very well, and, uh, when I did have jobs, I usually weren’t able to keep those jobs. And then I learned to read and write by forcing myself to read an encyclopedia. And I applied to go to an art school.\nXS: I would like to hear more about how you built the confidence to pursue an artistic career, which I see as quite risky. \nT: It was a little scary, but because Mommy did so much supporting us, it wasn’t as scary as if I was the only breadwinner. And my joke was always that I did all the cooking and the sewing. And Mommy did the brickwork and the plumbing. \nAnd when you girls were growing up, I made it a point that we would always have family meals on the weekend. And I wanted to raise my girls as really strong, powerful women. I would always say, ‘What can I do? As a parent, to make your life better?’ You girls would say, ‘I didn’t like when you raised your voice.’ And then I would learn to not be so tough on you. But you’re navigating the world very well, all of you.\nXS: I’m 38, the age that you were when you had me. What advice do you have for me? \nT: The sad thing about human beings is that we tend to remember the unhappy things. And I think my advice to you is just try to be happy. The longest life is short.\n \nBACK ANNOUNCE:\n \nFor StoryCorps in Philadelphia, that’s Tchin and Xiao Hui Star.\nTheir conversation is archived in the Library of

And in 2020, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\nHe wanted to record with his wife Arshe to leave something behind for their 3 year old daughter Radiyya, who they adopted from Pakistan.\nSohaib Sultan (SS) and Arshe Ahmed (AA)\nSS: You and I would stay up till 12 o’clock at night, waiting to make that phone call to Pakistan, reminding them that we were inquiring about a child. And they would always say, ‘There’s no child for you.’ You know, I’ve wanted to be a father since I was a little kid. And I think hearing those words night after night, it was sad.\nBut, the moment they said, ‘We have a baby for you,’ I just remember this feeling of joy. \nAA: Yeah. Seeing her for the first time and holding her was just the most gorgeous moment of my life.\nSo, do you remember the day when you got your full diagnosis?\nSS: They called and they said, ‘You probably have a year to live.’ But It didn’t feel like all bad news. \nAA: Hmm.\nSS: Like, think about the 40 years that God has given me. What a beautiful life. What a purposeful life. What a blessed life.\nBut, Radiyya is always asking, ‘Are you better now?’ You know, I say, ‘Abba is not going to get better.’ And when she says, ‘But then I’ll cry and I’ll cry.’ I remember saying to her, ‘Aap insaan ho. Ronaa theek hay.’ You’re a human being, so it’s okay to cry, to be sad.\nAnd you’ve told me that one of the hardest things you imagine is explaining to her where I am. \nAA: Yeah, When she wakes up in the morning and she looks over to our bed and says, ‘Where’s Abba?’ And you’re in the bathroom. I can’t but think about that moment when I’m going to have to answer that differently. That’s going to be a hard one for me. \nSS: You know, I feel a lot of sorrow in my heart thinking about that moment. \nAA: Yeah.\nSS: But, even though I won’t be there physically, just know that I’ll be there spiritually. You won’t be alone.\nSo many people have said, ‘We’re praying for a miracle.’ But I always chuckle at that because I feel like my entire life has been a miracle. And one of them is finding you. \nWhat you’ve done for me, waking up in the middle of the night, almost every night for the past three months, because I’m in pain. Those are the things that I hope Radiyya really knows, that that’s how you took care of me.\nAA: Yeah. You know I’m just grateful for each moment that we get.\nSS: My hope is that Radiyya will live life beautifully, no matter how long God gives her. And you are especially going to teach her what it means to take life as a gift and to live it out every day.\n\nClose"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-14T15:11:50.389989Z","updated_at":"2024-04-21T23:38:26.636302Z","inner_id":16,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":215,"annotations":[{"id":205,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":6,"end":102,"text":"Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…","labels":["Turn"]},"id":"_YR6-hwFey","from_name":"turn","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":6,"end":102,"text":"Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…","choices":["Declarative Clause"]},"id":"_YR6-hwFey","from_name":"clause_type","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":6,"end":102,"text":"Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…","choices":["Statement"]},"id":"_YR6-hwFey","from_name":"speech_act","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":160,"end":198,"text":"When I was seventeen, I got pregnant.

And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.\nSM: Wow. I just wasn’t ready for that.\nJM: I’m sure.\nSM: I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.\nJM: That’s something I can’t make better for you. And I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but… you’ll be okay…\n[MUSIC]\nHOST: They came back in 2023. At 88, Jackie’s health was declining… Realizing his mom was nearing the end of life… Scott wanted to do one more interview… \nTranscript TRT: [2:11]\nJackie Miller (JM) and Scott Miller (SM)\nSM: I cannot believe 15 years have passed. \nJM: I don’t have any more revelations to unleash on you. \nSM: [laughs]\nJM: And now I have an old person’s voice. It cracks…\nBut I still don’t think of myself as old.\nI mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back. But that doesn’t keep me from doing it. The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot. He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.\nSM: [laughs]\nJM: But my world is really getting smaller. Words don’t come that easily to me now.\nIt’s really scary. The other day, I couldn’t remember my cell phone number. I recognize this is part of getting not older but old, you know?\nSM: Yeah… You know in our first interview I had said, uh… it scares me imagining life without you, and it doesn’t so much scare me anymore. But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it. You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.\nSo when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone… \nIt feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice. \nJM: One of the things every parent wants to know is just, how happy are you with your life?\nSM: I’m very happy about my life.\nJM: I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.\nSM: I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you… There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that.
