And in his honor, organizers had planned a day of events and celebration to be held at the monument. But...SUMMERS: But the Eiffel Tower, which is typically open 365 days a year and draws around 6 million visitors annually, was closed today as union workers at the tower went on strike ahead of contract negotiations with the city, citing complaints about poor management.SHAPIRO: So instead of climbing to the top of the tower for that perfect selfie, tourists had to pack up and escargot home.SUMMERS: That's right. They had two baguette lost until, well, whenever the strike is over.
