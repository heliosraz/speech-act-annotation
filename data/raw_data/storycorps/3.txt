Qaiyaan Harcharek (QH) and Don Rearden (DR)
QH: It seemed as if we knew each other our whole lives, it’s kind of strange.
DR: Yeah, right away. I don’t think the average person can understand what it’s like to grow up in a place where you lose so many people to suicide.
QH: It’s tough.
DR: Yeah, it is. The first person that I knew intimately, who took his own life, was a teammate of mine. I was just a freshman in high school. And he had moved into Bethel to play basketball. We were good friends. 
And then that summer I found out he, you know, took his life. And then, that fall, I lost another classmate. Pretty soon it was like a whole gym full of people… that I knew personally who are gone.
QH: I could relate. 100 percent. All of my adult life, I’ve had struggles with mental health and depression, and I’m a suicide survivor… I attempted it.
However, I have this vision, I don’t – it’s hard to describe, but it was… my wife and children reaching up to me. And there were many, many silhouettes around them of people, with faces, and yours was one of them. 
DR: [chuckles]
QH: What I do know is… it was the love that I received from each and every one of those people that saved my life.
