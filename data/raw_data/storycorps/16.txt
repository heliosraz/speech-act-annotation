John Cruitt (JC) and Cecile Doyle (CD)
 
JC: When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you. And you bent over and kissed me on the head. It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.’ And I felt that things really would be OK.
 
CD: When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died. And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person.
 
JC: Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’
 
CD: And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill. And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.
 
JC: Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter. I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards. Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.
 
 
Host: Cecile Doyle died in 2019.
 
After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.
 
 
John Cruitt (JC) and Allison Doyle (AD)
 
JC: My relationship with you is very important to me. Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved. And when I met you, it made me feel so much better. 
 
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?
 
AD: To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another… And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.
 
JC: It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had. It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.
 
AD: We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends. And we had that book at her funeral service. So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief… Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us. And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind.  
 
JC: I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.
 
AD: And that was in a big way John. I almost feel like you’re a brother.
 
JC: I suspect our mothers have something to do with that. 
 
AD: They might quite well. Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think. So what a gift they gave us.
 
JC: They certainly did.
