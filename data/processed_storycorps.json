I mean, we live in such a culture of, you know, even when you look at the best seller list, you\u2019ve got these books that are all the way on the right and all the way on the left.

When I got back, the country was almost as angry as some of the factions I remember seeing in Afghanistan. It felt like a country that was always on the verge of either tearing itself, apart or picking a fight. And I didn\u2019t remember that from when I left. So it was very strange for me to come back and feel the anger.\n\u00a0\nIf you think of being in a deployed environment, you want to stay in the yellow light, cautious, ready to go but recognizing that things haven\u2019t jumped off just yet. And it kind of felt like that. It felt like, Ooh, we\u2019re in a situation here. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: Whenever there\u2019s a national crisis or tragedy of some sort\u2026 StoryCorps has always tried to find ways to be helpful.\n\u00a0\nMG: When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks.

A lot of us have a tendency to shut out people we don\u2019t agree with\u2026 so One Small Step asks us to do the opposite\u2026 to actually get to know each other.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: The basis of the whole conversation is, you know, yes, we probably disagree on most things, but we\u2019re having this conversation anyway. And by the end of it, We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: You know, these days the voices telling us that we\u2019re supposed to hate each other are so loud\u2026 and so pervasive\u2026 One Small Step really feels like David taking on Goliath\u2026 but we\u2019ve never shied from a challenge before\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: And there\u2019s scientific evidence that something like this can make a difference. One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.\n\u00a0\nMG: The idea is that under very specific circumstances\u2026 when people who consider themselves enemies are put together one on one\u2026 they can actually come out the other side of that experience understanding and accepting each other\u2026 and sometimes they even become friends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: One of the keys is that phrase \u201cvery specific circumstances\u201d \u2013 so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.\n\u00a0\nMG: Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other\u2026 but One Small Step interviews are between strangers. Here\u2019s Mary Bess again\u2026\n\u00a0\nMBS: The fact that they\u2019re strangers really makes it less threatening. So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother \u2013 that may or may not be my story \u2013\u00a0 it\u2019s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there\u2019s no relationship at stake. You come to the table with a clean slate. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Here\u2019s how it works \u2013 people sign up online \u2013 there\u2019s a questionnaire that asks them to rate how they feel about social and economic issues\u2026 how important religion is in their lives\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: They can select from a list of terms to identify themselves\u2026 things like parent, grandparent or veteran.\u00a0 And they write a short bio\u2026 describing themselves in their own words \u2013 and that gets shared with their interview partner.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Then someone from StoryCorps \u2013 like Mary Bess \u2013 matches them up with a stranger.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: There\u2019s a real person doing the pairing\u2026 not an algorithm.\n\u00a0\nMBS: They don\u2019t see the reason why we\u2019ve matched them. Really they show up to the interview, you know, not knowing at all what to expect, and usually people realize that they\u2019ve come to the table with a lot of assumptions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Here\u2019s one example. It comes from Birmingham, Alabama\u2026 where Cassandra Adams, a liberal, was paired with David Wilson, a conservative.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCassandra Adams (CA): Lemme ask you this, when you read my bio\u2026\n\u00a0\nDavid Wilson (DW): Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nCA: What did you think? And please be as honest as you feel comfortable because nothing would bother me.\n\u00a0\nDW: Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype\u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCA: Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nDW: She\u2019s probably dyed in the wool democrat, end of story.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCA: [laughs]\n\u00a0\nDW: Second part was intriguing because you said something along the lines of an open mind and I thought, well this would be interesting.\n\u00a0\nCA: When I read your bio I just thought you were a white man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDW: [laughs]\n\u00a0\nCA: I thought I was gonna come in here and just be like\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDW: [laughs] I don\u2019t even know what it was! I don\u2019t remember what it was!\n\u00a0\nCA: And that\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting to me! Is that I\u2019m just like\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDW: Stereotype!\n\u00a0\nCA: That\u2019s exactly right! So I have to admit it because when you walked in the door and I stood up and introduce myself I was like \u2018oops, oops, oops.\u2019\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMBS: To have this opportunity to match people, like they\u2019re dating, and there\u2019s always some sort of coincidence that we didn\u2019t even know about. One interview, we found out that both participants, I mean, they couldn\u2019t be more different, but they\u2019re both foster parents, and we didn\u2019t know that. That wasn\u2019t even a point of connection where I thought, oh, they\u2019re so different, but they\u2019re foster parents. This will be a great conversation. Nope. I didn\u2019t even know.\u00a0 They had a great time. They wanted to go out for coffee afterwards.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: Yeah. I mean, that really is something, right? Because we\u2019re told constantly, talking about the other side, like, oh, those people, we can\u2019t possibly have anything in common with them, and then it\u2019s amazing to hear that there\u2019s almost always something.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: Yeah, and it can be something completely uninteresting too it could be like, Oh, both of these people are into intermittent fasting, you know, like, (laughs) but they have something to talk about, you know, that, (laughs) and they realize that it\u2019s the shared humanity aspect of it, you know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\nJM: Here\u2019s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona. Their connection\u2026 was parenting.\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: I\u2019ve been stretched and challenged far beyond I knew was possible. You know? And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one? Right? And your heart just seems to have all kinds of elastic in it. It doesn\u2019t ever wear out. Right? You know? (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Pretty amazing.\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: Yeah. So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: That\u2019s a great question. My dad would say, \u201cWell you can do that if you want. I prefer this.\u201d And he let us see that opportunity for ourselves. I remember when I told him I wanted to try smoking cigarettes. And he said, \u201cWell, I personally prefer to breathe clean air, but if that\u2019s your choice, then you go for it\u201d and took the excitement out of it. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: But, you actually told him that. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Yeah. Yeah.\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: That you had that relationship you could do that.\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Yes. I feel like I lean toward that with my children\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: You know I think what a gift your father gave you. So I\u2019m very much a daddy\u2019s girl. I connected with him. He was my junior senior high school principal. So 7th through 12th grade. And when I was going into 7th grade, you know, he made sure he had a conversation with me where he said, \u201cYou know, your mom and I think you\u2019re pretty special but, because you\u2019re my daughter, you\u2019re probably going to have few friends and you probably won\u2019t have anybody who will want to date you. And it\u2019s not because you don\u2019t have a lot to offer, but it\u2019s primarily because of whose daughter you are.\u201d The fact that he did that, laid that out for a 12-year-old girl, he set the tone for me to know what the road was going to be like. And we didn\u2019t have a lot of conversations, you know? And I don\u2019t know how often my father ever said I love you, but I know he loved me.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Who knew how that was going to go? Like you said, it\u2019s unscripted. We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right? Like that. Let me give you a hug.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMBS: A lot of people think that, Oh, one small step, these conversations, people are going to attack each other, you know, it\u2019s going to get ugly. And honestly, it\u2019s the opposite.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome people don\u2019t want to participate because they say, well, I don\u2019t really know, I\u2019m not really well versed in what\u2019s going on in politics right now.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s where we say, you know, you don\u2019t have to prepare for this experience. You don\u2019t have to, this isn\u2019t a debate. You don\u2019t need to bring a briefcase full of, you know, the most recent articles. you just bring your life experience and talk about what you care about, what your life has been like and listen to someone else do the same and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\u00a0\nJM: So there ARE some other ways One Small Step interviews are different from standard StoryCorps conversations\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: Each One Small Step interview starts with the participants reading each other\u2019s bios out loud\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: And then a trained facilitator guides them through the conversation with questions from a list designed specifically for One Small Step.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: One of the questions is can you describe in your own words, your personal political values? The way it\u2019s phrased you\u2019re asked to talk about why you care about something, why it\u2019s important to you, why you believe X, Y, or Z. So you\u2019re still talking about your own life. You\u2019re still telling stories, you know, how your grandfather influenced you, or, you know, you grew up poor.\n\u00a0\nMG: It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: Right.\n\u00a0\nMG: And makes it about understanding, which is, like, a completely different approach\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: Yeah, I mean you can still walk out of the room and think, you know, that person everything they stand for is completely wrong, but, somehow, I enjoyed speaking with them, or somehow I kind of respect them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: This next conversation comes from Columbus, Georgia\u2026 Alton Russell is the former Chair of the Republican party there\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: And he was paired with Wane Hailes\u2026 who was the President of the local chapter of the NAACP.\n\u00a0\nThese guys knew of each other\u2026 but they had never spoken before this interview.\n\u00a0\nAlton:\u200a I went to Houston looking for a job in this little old bitty office. There was a guy sitting at the desk. He said, um, \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d And I said, \u201cAnything as long as it\u2019s legal.\u201d He says, \u201cGood answer. How about 40 dollars a week?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes sir.\u201d This was 1961. He said, by the way, \u201cMy name is George Bush.\u201d It was George H. W. Bush.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: Really.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Yes, sir. And he was running for Congress. What my job was is I made yard signs with a wooden stake and a piece of poster board and a stencil.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: But you\u2019ve never run for office?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: No, never have.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: You\u2019ve just been the kingmaker.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Well, I don\u2019t know about that. But I, no, I never have run.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: What do you do for a living?\n\u00a0\nAlton: Believe it or not, I\u2019m a toilet paper salesman.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: Really?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Yes, sir.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWayne: Two ply?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Two ply, wipe it up, yeah. I\u2019ve been there 40 years.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWayne: Is that right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Yeah. But you\u2019ve done a lot of different things too, and I\u2019m, I\u2019m just wondering how in the world did you wind up in Columbus, Georgia? Did you take a wrong turn?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: I was working for the YMCA, and the YMCA here called and said, \u201cWould I be interested?\u201d But as the president of the NAACP, I can tell you how I got into that.\n\u00a0\nWhen we were, uh, growing up, about 8 or 9 years old, we were traveling to my grandfather\u2019s house and we stopped at a laundromat. And when we went in,\u00a0 they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t wash black folks clothes here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nWane: Of course, they didn\u2019t use black folks word. My father being a preacher, you know, he was cool, but my mother was ready to go off, you know, and we went on to my grandfather\u2019s house and he got on the phone and he called the NAACP. About 30 minutes later, they said, going back up to the laundromat. And the white owner stood in the corner while we washed our clothes, red as a beet. So I\u2019m like, Oh man, that was a memory that\u2019s always been in my mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Sure.\n\u00a0\nWane: And how it worked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: You know what? I have a good friend of mine. We went to breakfast one morning and when we left this guy that was in the restaurant with us came out and followed me to my truck. And he said, um, \u201cAre you Alton Russell?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d He says, \u201cWell, I saw you on TV the other day.\u201d He said, \u201cBut I got a question. How can you be a Republican and eat breakfast with that black guy?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did you say? That guy\u2019s a friend of mine. You\u2019re way off base.\u201d We got things to do, and worrying about whether you\u2019re a man, a woman, black, or white is not what you need to be focusing on.\n\u00a0\nWane: Yeah. Well I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve got a whole different view of you. You know, my perception was, okay, he\u2019s always going to be over here. I\u2019m not going to even talk with him. But this has been, this has been eye opening for me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Well, it has to me too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: And I can go tell some people, \u201cHey, Alton\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s alright.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: It\u2019s been fun. And I\u2019m really glad to have met you; I sure am.\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMBS: People have come to believe that these conversations are possible. So that in and of itself, I think, is an increase in hope. And I don\u2019t know if you can quantify it, hope, but, um, you know, the belief that we can have these conversations, especially in an election year, you know, you wonder, well, is this the right time for one small step? And I think it\u2019s even more important at those times because that\u2019s when we most definitely do not want to talk to each other.\n\u00a0\nJM: Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory? That idea that if people from different groups come together 1 on 1\u2026 they can start to see each other as human?\n\u00a0\nMG: One Small Step interviews are definitely helping that to happen. But the harder thing to make happen\u2026 is to have that feeling generalize\u2026 to not be just about that one individual you met\u2026 but about a whole group\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Well, there\u2019s a social psychologist at Yale, Jennifer Richeson\u2026 and she\u2019s been studying One Small Step and the impact it\u2019s having on participants\u2026 And she\u2019s finding evidence that\u2026 for some people who record with us\u2026 this feeling IS beginning to generalize.\n\u00a0\nMBS: Sometimes people say, well, I didn\u2019t see fireworks, it didn\u2019t change me, but they really enjoyed the other person\u2019s company and they were surprised by that, or They really felt like they understood each other and that really surprised them. It definitely chips away at that us versus them mentality just a little bit. And, you know, that\u2019s why we say it\u2019s one small step. It\u2019s not a magic cure. We\u2019re not calling it that. It\u2019s just One Small Step in the right direction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: We\u2019ll be back\u2026 right after the break. Stay with us\u2026\n\u00a0\n[Break]\n\u00a0\nMG: So, Jasmyn, here we are\u2026 the last segment of the final episode of this series.\n\u00a0\nJM: We made it\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: Yeah. You know, one of the big takeaways for me looking back on these past twenty years\u2026 it\u2019s related to what Mary Bess said a few minutes ago\u2026 about increasing hope. I think at its root, that\u2019s a big part of what StoryCorps is about\u2026 and I don\u2019t mean like cheap greeting card expressions of hope\u2026 but the kind of hope that grows out of hard work\u2026 and having people surprise you.\n\u00a0\nJM: Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step. Earlier this year, in a \u201cMr Isay Goes to Washington\u201d moment\u2026 Dave brought One Small Step to the annual baseball game between members of Congress at Nationals stadium in DC\u2026 and he showed a video on the jumbotron challenging them to participate\u2026 and some of them actually did\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: And soon we\u2019re rolling out this new do-it-yourself online version of One Small Step, so that strangers anywhere in the country can record an interview. You could have a person from the bluest county in America getting to know someone from the reddest county\u2026 I mean, for me personally at this moment in history\u2026 it\u2019s just really incredible to work at a place where the underlying ethos is optimism.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Yeah and I think for me having listened to A LOT of StoryCorps interviews over the years\u2026 and it\u2019s really beautiful to hear someone take the time to sit down with another person, especially an elder to capture wisdom from their family\u2026\u00a0 you know, before it\u2019s lost. But for those of who get to do this work\u2026 we\u2019ve been able to listen to thousands of these interviews, thousands of\u00a0 grandparents\u2026 or parents or couples and absorb basically generations of wisdom\u2026 And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever told you this but I actually used to keep a folder of little clips from interviews whenever I heard little gems \u2026 that I just wanted to keep for myself, stuff I could use in my own life. What a gift.\n\u00a0\nMG: Very cool. Another thing that strikes me is that after 20 years\u2026 the basic idea of a StoryCorps interview really hasn\u2019t changed that much\u2026 and I mean that in the best way\u2026 it\u2019s held up\u2026 like no matter what\u2019s going on in the world\u2026 this way of taking an hour to connect with somebody\u2026 we want it\u2026 maybe we even need it.\n\u00a0\nJM: And we found something that really helps illustrate that point. We dug up the very first SC interview ever recorded\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: \u200aI\u2019m Dave Isay, and I\u2019m interviewing Sandy Birnbaum, who\u2019s my uncle, my great uncle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200aSandy Birnbaum (SB): Great Uncle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Sandy, this is a very special session here because, like I said, we\u2019re starting this whole national movement and you\u2019re interview number one.\n\u00a0\nJM: When they spoke in 2003\u2026 Sandy\u2019s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: The first date, she says, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the doorway just past the liquor store after work.\u201d And I was standing in the doorway, and it\u2019s inset a little bit.\u00a0 And finally I see this vision of purple coming down the street, a purple hat and a purple coat, and I think she had purple shoes and stockings on, too and uh, it\u00a0 was so glamorous. I says, What the hell am I, a two bit farm boy? This is such a sophisticated woman. I mean, she\u2019s way beyond me. So I turned to the doorway, and I tried to duck out, but the door was locked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Cries) If the door was open, it would have ended there and the best thing that\u2026 (Cries) Well anyhow, uh, the door was locked and, uh, we had just so much fun.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Birdie was the love of your life?\n\u00a0\nSB: Oh yeah, yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: What did you love about her?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: You know I\u2019ve never been asked that question. Just her warmth. She was everything that I wasn\u2019t. She filled in all the, uh, deficiencies I had, which were considerable, mostly in regard to shyness and to, uh, self confidence and things like that. Everybody loved her, and she was a good person to have with you. Oh God,\u00a0 I remember\u2026\n\u00a0\nDI: Thank you, Sandy. So let me ask you a question. It is helpful to talk about this, yeah?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: Uh.\n\u00a0\nDI: Or is it not?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Is it damaging to bring up?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: Oh, no.. it\u2019s a good feeling. Break out crying or you choke up and you can\u2019t say a word, that\u2019s a good feeling? Yeah, it is. Because, you know, you don\u2019t have to pretend that you\u2019re being a brave soul. (laughs) Gutting it through. You\u2019re just letting go. It\u2019s a good feeling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Let me get you home.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: Okay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Thank you, Sandy.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: Hundreds of thousands of interviews later, it\u2019s hard to imagine how many moments like this exist in the archive.\n\u00a0\nMG: And it\u2019s hard to measure the impact of those moments\u2026on the people who recorded interviews\u2026and also on the people who have helped build StoryCorps\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: So we\u2019re going to leave you with a conversation I recently had with Dave about just that\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: So, for this last episode, looking back on twenty years, so many people have contributed to making StoryCorps what it is now, of course. And we\u2019ve all had life changes. I\u2019ve gotten married, had children in this time.\n\u00a0\nDI: Me too. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nJM: Right! Lots of people have put their whole selves into this work. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Yeah, well, I mean I think that everybody when they leave StoryCorps to a person and, you know, we\u2019ve had thousands of employees at this point over the years, you know, everyone says that the best thing about StoryCorps are the people. The StoryCorps team has never ceased to amaze me and, you know, that\u2019s why we are what we are.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, true story and kind of crazy, but our first corporate sponsor was Hebrew National Hot Dogs. I don\u2019t know why. I have absolutely no idea.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nDI: But their, um, motto famously was, We answer to a higher authority and, you know, I think that\u2019s how all of us have felt at StoryCorps over these past 20 years, that this is sacred work and it draws a very special person to do this work. And it\u2019s very hard work. There\u2019s nothing viral or easy about StoryCorps. You know, but it\u2019s drawn people who just refuse to give up and I think that\u2019s part of the secret sauce and the magic of StoryCorps.\n\u00a0\nOne of the original StoryCorps employees\u2013we started with four or five\u2013and one of them was a guy named Matt Ozug. And when he left he said at his goodbye party that \u201cStoryCorps is hard work and love work and blood work.\u201d You know, truer words have never been spoken. But, um, you know, it\u2019s been worth every bit of it, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful to the staff who helped make this dream come true.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: So what are your hopes for the future, for the next 20 years?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Some people have said to me over the years that, you know, if aliens came to earth and they could only find one thing, they hoped it would be the StoryCorps archive because it really, it shows the best in us, but it also shows who we really are and that is the best in us.\n\u00a0\nUm, and I, you know, I hope that the ethos of StoryCorps, that the idea that all of our lives and all of our stories matter equally and infinitely, the idea that we should treat each other with respect, that nobody\u2019s the worst thing they\u2019ve they\u2019ve ever done, that people should be given a second chance that it flows through the veins of the country and participating in StoryCorps and listening to StoryCorps stories becomes part of what it means to be an American and that StoryCorps grows into an institution that outlives us all.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: This episode was produced by MIchael Garofalo, Jud Esty-Kendall, and me. Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer. Special thanks to Kerrie Hillman, Mary Bess Ser, Neil Griffith, and all our One Small Step partners\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website. There, you can learn more about ALL the work we do\u2026and how to add your story to the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019m Michael Garofalo.\n\u00a0\nJM: And I\u2019m Jasmyn Morris.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs always, thanks for listening.\n\nClose"}, "predictions": [{"model_version": "one", "result": [{"value": {"start": 20, "end": 131, "text": "Let\u2019s go back

It was good while it lasted, but I must go.\u00a0\nNB: You act like it\u2019s the ending of a relationship [Laughs].\u00a0\u00a0\nCB: It is!\u00a0\nNB: Well, yeah, I guess it is\u2026 but\u2013\nCB: Because no more mother and daughter. It\u2019s just daughter, mother gone.\nNB: Yeah. But you won\u2019t have to worry about oxygen.\u00a0\nCB: I know that\u2019s the truth. No more medicine. Oh, to think\u2013\nNB: No. You just have to slow down.\u00a0\nCB: Yeah, I try to do that. And then I forget what I\u2019m doing.\u00a0\nNB: Well, don\u2019t slow down that much.\u00a0\nCB: Oh\u2026 Well, what about you? What would you do?\u00a0\u00a0\nNB: If this was my last conversation?\nCB: Yes.\u00a0\nNB: Yeah, I would tell you the same thing, that I love you.\u00a0\nCB: Do you want to be cremated?\nNB: Yes.\u00a0\nCB: Oh yeah. And where you want us to throw you? In the toilet, the garbage can?\u00a0\nNB: No, not the garbage can. All that, it didn\u2019t make no sense to get me cremated [Laughs].\u00a0\nCB: Okay, so sorry.\u00a0\nNB: Just get me cremated and throw me out back?\nCB: Yeah [Laughs]. We could use some soil and, you know, plant a tree.\nNB: Oh yeah\u2026 That would be awesome.\u00a0\nCB: Uuuhuu.\nNB: Something that can give fruit, you know.\u00a0\nCB: That can give back.\u00a0\nNB: Yes, give it back. So for your great great grandchild listening to this years from now, is there any wisdom you want to pass on to them?\nCB: You know, you don\u2019t have to be religious to believe in something, \u2018cause religion is what you do every day. And they got a song that say, \u2018You don\u2019t miss your water \u2018til your well run dry.\u2019 That\u2019s why you\u2019re supposed to treat people kind while they\u2019re alive.\u00a0\nNB: Yeah.\nCB: And when your well dry, you want to see that person again. But it\u2019s all over.\u00a0\nNB: Yup.\nCB: You know, we made do girl\u2026 Eventually, I\u2019ve gotta go. And I know it\u2019s gonna break your heart. I\u2019ll be sad that I\u2019m gone \u2018cause I won\u2019t have you to talk to.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s gonna be alright.

weight\u2026 doctors incorrectly diagnosed them with an eating disorder.\nBut on one visit to the hospital\u2026 a doctor on-call discovered a rare stomach tumor.\nThat doctor, John Fortunato, would stay with the family through Angel\u2019s treatment up until their death in 2023.\nAt StoryCorps in Chicago, Dr. Fortunato sat down with Angel\u2019s father for this conversation.\nJohn Fortunato (JF) and Robert Robinson (RR)\nJF: My first memory of meeting Angel was in the hospital. When I walked in the room, Angel was smiling the whole time. A teenager who was\u2026 in control of the room.\u00a0\nAnd I remember she told me to push her on her belly and I could make her throw up.\nAfter I diagnosed Angel with the tumor, what was your first response to that?\nRR: Before you discovered it, no one would listen to her. Even me.\nAnd\u2026 I still regret that. But I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0\nThey were saying it was an eating disorder. And, when you go to the doctor, you\u2019re trusting the professionals. You just, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s what the doctor said, that\u2019s what it is.\u2019 So I\u2019m kind of trying to push her, you know what I mean? And it\u2019s not her fault.\u00a0\nJF: Parents, myself included, don\u2019t always see things clearly, especially as it relates to teenagers. But that doesn\u2019t mean a parent\u2019s doing something wrong. I never tell someone not to feel guilty because that\u2019s not a fair expectation. But, we just do the best we can to support and love our kids.\u00a0\n\u200aAnd that\u2019s something that amazed me\u2026 you being a single father of twins, and somehow spending an incredible amount of time and energy with both your daughters.\u00a0\nRR: Nothing else mattered to me but my kids. We couldn\u2019t rely on anybody but each other. It was us against the world type of situation that I feel made her stronger, mentally.\u00a0\nCause it\u2019s lot of times I wanted to be like\u2026 \u2018Well, if you\u2019re gonna die anyway, forget doing this chemo. You can keep your hair.\u2019 And she would, \u2018Nah, we don\u2019t give up. I\u2019m gonna keep fighting.\u2019\nJF: Sometimes you sink or swim and I got the impression that Angel was not gonna sink under any circumstances.\nRR: No, she wasn\u2019t.\nJF: I wasn\u2019t ready to give up either. But I realized, you know, after a while\u2026 it was a, just, almost impossible situation.\nRR: When Angel died, I just remember, standing over her trying to talk to her and her eyes was open but she wasn\u2019t responsive. And her sister was singing to her. And her heart rate was dropping, it was going from 180, it went down to 140. From 140 it went down to 80. From 80 it went down to 40 and\u2026 it was over.\nJF: I wish that none of this had ever happened to your family but she, um, reminded me kinda what I got into this career to begin with for\u2026 and that\u2019s the only regret is I wish I could have told her what her impact was.\nRR: And I really appreciate those times, everyone was saying \u2018It\u2019s a wrap,\u2019 you know what I mean?\nFor you to still be there and be like, \u2018Nah, there\u2019s still stuff you can do, you ain\u2019t gotta blow the trumpet just yet.\u2019 When a time when there wasn\u2019t any hope, that really lifted us up.\n\u00a0\n\nClose"}, "predictions": [{"model_version": "one", "result": [{"value": {"start": 6, "end": 136, "text": "When Robert Robinson\u2019s daughter, Angel, started rapidly losing weight\u2026 doctors incorrectly diagnosed them with an eating disorder\\.", "labels": ["Turn"]}, "from_name": "Turn", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 137, "end": 220, "text": "But on one visit to the hospital\u2026 a doctor on-call discovered a rare stomach tumor\\.", "labels": ["Turn"]}, "from_name": "Turn", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 221, "end": 332, "text": "That doctor, John Fortunato, would stay with the family through Angel\u2019s treatment up until their death in 2023\\.", "labels": ["Turn"]}, "from_name": "Turn", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 333, "end": 424, "text": "At StoryCorps in Chicago, Dr\\.

2, the Marine Corps officially opened its ranks to Black men.\u00a0\nMore than 19,000 Black recruits signed up \u2026\u00a0 and became known as the Montford Point Marines \u2026 Named for the North Carolina base where they trained.\u00a0\nMost of these men have passed away, but through the StoryCorps Archive \u2026 we can still hear their stories \u2026 \nMari Ann Roberts: Do you remember the first time you put on the uniform?\u00a0\nEstel Roberts: I just felt like, oh, I\u2019m a proud Marine, you know. I thought I was something.\u00a0\nBenjamin Jenkins: I wanted to help fight for our country, and also show that we had the courage and intelligence to do so.\u00a0\nWilliam Pickens: We knew we were the best. Well we made it our business to be the best of the best. Not mediocre but the best. \nHOST (SS): We\u2019re going to hear now from Corporal Sidney Allen Francis.\u00a0\nAfter serving as one of the first Black Marines\u2026 he worked as a New York City police detective\u2026 and in 2005 spoke with his daughter, Candice, at StoryCorps.\nSidney Francis (SF): I wanted to go into the Army, but they said no.\u00a0\nCandice Francis (CF): And this was World War II?\u00a0\nSF: Yeah. And they stamped my papers \u2018Navy,\u2019 and there was no way in the Hell I was going to the Navy.\nCF: Why didn\u2019t you want to go in the Navy?\nSF: I didn\u2019t like the little hats they were in, the little \u2026 [laughs] So then I said, \u2018What about the Marine Corps?\u2019 The guy says, \u2018Well, you have to go \u2018round and see the Sergeant Major.\u2019 First thing he said to me: \u2018Are you a high school graduate?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 And I went to North Carolina for boot camp.\nCF: And what was that like?\u00a0\nSF: I mean, they were rough.\u00a0\nCF: Now, were your drill instructors, were they white or Black?\u00a0\nSF: No, they were Black. But see, they had trained under white instructors because up to 1942, the Marine Corps had no Blacks. And that\u2019s why they were extra tough on us. They wanted us to make it. And, uh, we did.\nWell, I have to tell you, I once went to jail down there. I was with my buddy from New York, he was in the Marine Corps, and we were going to Raleigh from Montford Point. And we\u2019re sitting in the back of the bus. Then the bus stopped to pick up people, and the bus driver came up and he said, uh, \u2018You guys will have to get up.\u2019\nI said, \u2018Get up for what?\u2019 He says, \u2018These white people have to sit down.\u2019 I said, \u2018We\u2019re in the back of the bus.\u2019 He said, \u2018You ought to get up.\u2019 And I lost my head then. I says, \u2018We\u2019re not getting up.\u2019 And lo and behold, in not even 10 minutes, in comes police with guns drawn. And they took me that night to some little prison camp. And in the morning I heard, \u2018Warden, this is Major Pauper, United States Marine Corps. You got one of my boys in there.\u2019\nAll the Marines from Montford Point, they were on six by six trucks with machine guns at the ready. You could see they just wanted to tear that jail down. And when I came out, Major Pauper, he says, \u2018PFC Francis, you get on that truck. We\u2019re out of here.\u2019\nAnd he hollered it back, \u2018Thank you, Warden, that you didn\u2019t hurt one of my Marines.\u2019 He said, \u2018You would have been in trouble.\u2019\nHOST (SS): That was Sidney Allen Francis speaking with his daughter, Candice. Sidney died February 15, 2014. His daughter recently came back to StoryCorps\nCandice: So I didn\u2019t know that story before. He had never shared that with me, but it sounded like my father. I wasn\u2019t surprised by that at all. You know, a lot of Black men who served this country had to also suffer indignities, even while in uniform. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve gotten the credit that they deserve for putting their lives in danger.\nAnd coming out of it with scars that didn\u2019t come from the so-called enemy, but came from within. But what I appreciate about my father is that he used his military service to give him what he needed to build a life for himself and his family. It gave him purpose, and it gave him an anchor \u2026 And I\u2019m grateful for that.\u00a0\n***\n\nCF: So what do you want your grandchildren to know about you?\u00a0\nSF: I want them to just remember that I loved them, that\u2019s all. There\u2019s nothing exciting about me. I\u2019m just a man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nClose"}, "predictions": [{"model_version": "one", "result": [{"value": {"start": 11, "end": 123, "text": "The StoryCorps\u2019 Military Voices Initiative

longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone.\u00a0\nAt StoryCorps\u2026 she remembered what this work meant to her.\nDenise Tuite (DT): The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building. The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.\u00a0 It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it was our place. You know, it was beautiful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTypical calls were, I\u2019m coming to New York, what\u2019s the best\u00a0 bar for lesbians specifically? But then every once in a while you\u2019d get somebody that would call and just want to talk\u2026 Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something. \u2018Should I tell my parents?

Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school\u2026 and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14. And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn\u2019t want to be with him. And my mother? She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nShe felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters. So when I graduated high school, my mother didn\u2019t want me in the house anymore.

But that wasn\u2019t who I was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay\u2026 there\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what people wanted to hear.
