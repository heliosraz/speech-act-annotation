Annie Russell (AR): Time now for StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
Joseph Rogers Britton has spent 40 years caring for others.,['Declarative Clause']
"In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV",['Declarative Clause']
 And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Declarative Clause']
You know what the biggest joy was? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"Finding a smile in that small, sick child. ",['Declarative Clause']
That just made my week.,['Declarative Clause']
During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Declarative Clause']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work",['Declarative Clause']
Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Declarative Clause']
" We missed every single dinner date, every movie. ",['Declarative Clause']
And that led into a thirty year relationship,['Declarative Clause']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Declarative Clause']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses. ",['Declarative Clause']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother. ",['Declarative Clause']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Declarative Clause']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Declarative Clause']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Exclamatory Clause']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s not the glitz. ,['Declarative Clause']
It’s the simple touches.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV,['Exclamatory Clause']
You see everything as an opportunity because you’re here.,['Declarative Clause']
I can guarantee it,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you really believe and you live – if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.",['Declarative Clause']
"Over the last year, Mary Johnson-Roy has been getting a steady stream of visitors… all there to basically say one thing…",['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, Mary",['Declarative Clause']
 I love you.,['Declarative Clause']
I thank you so much just for being in my life,['Declarative Clause']
" I love you, sister Mary",['Declarative Clause']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy,['Declarative Clause']
 Mary lives in Minneapolis,['Declarative Clause']
And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide,['Declarative Clause']
"f it wasn’t for Mary, I don’t know where I would be as a grieving mother",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, I know that I wouldn’t be here. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Mary’s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.",['Declarative Clause']
But there’s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work…,['Declarative Clause']
Her connection to the man who killed her son…,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Mary Johnson. ,['Declarative Clause']
I am Oshea Israel,['Declarative Clause']
My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I’m her second son.,['Declarative Clause']
" From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps. ",['Declarative Clause']
I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Michael Garofalo,['Declarative Clause']
This week… a story you have to hear to believe.,['Declarative Clause']
"Let’s start at the beginning… in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis…",['Declarative Clause']
"My son, Laramiun, was intelligent.",['Declarative Clause']
 Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level,['Declarative Clause']
" He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy.",['Declarative Clause']
"e grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.",['Declarative Clause']
Fast forward to 1993…when Laramiun was 20…,['Declarative Clause']
"He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that’s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.",['Declarative Clause']
"One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time",['Declarative Clause']
 They got into a fight… and Oshea shot and killed him,['Declarative Clause']
Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.,['Declarative Clause']
"And over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son",['Declarative Clause']
And after a decade of trying to find peace… she decided to try something different… to visit Oshea in prison.,['Declarative Clause']
" I’m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s Regina Irwin, one of Mary’s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day",['Declarative Clause']
"As Mary was walking up to go to the prison, she stopped and she looked at me, and she said, “Regina, I can’t do it.”",['Declarative Clause']
And Mary was bending down almost like she was in labor.,['Declarative Clause']
"And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom",['Declarative Clause']
"And when she came out, she had prayed… and she was ready to go in. ",['Declarative Clause']
"As we were sitting at the table to meet Oshea, they had left a pitcher of water but they didn’t leave a glass for the man that had taken her son’s life",['Declarative Clause']
And Mary said “I will not sit here and not allow him to have a glass that he can drink water from just like everyone else here.”,['Declarative Clause']
And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink,['Declarative Clause']
We’ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next,['Declarative Clause']
This is from a conversation they had in 2011… shortly after Oshea finished serving his sentence,['Declarative Clause']
You and I met at Stillwater Prison,['Declarative Clause']
"I wanted to know if you were in the same mindset of what I remembered from court, where I wanted to go over and hurt you",['Declarative Clause']
 But you were not that 16-year-old. ,['Declarative Clause']
You were a grown man,['Declarative Clause']
 I shared with you about my son.,['Declarative Clause']
And he became human to me.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, when I met you it was like, ok, this guy is real",['Declarative Clause']
"And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can– just hug you like I would my own mother, you know",['Declarative Clause']
" After you left the room, I began to say: ”I just hugged the man that murdered my son.”",['Declarative Clause']
"nd I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you– I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you. ",['Declarative Clause']
As far as receiving forgiveness from you– sometimes I still don’t know how to take it because I haven’t totally forgiven myself yet.,['Declarative Clause']
 It’s something that I’m learning from you – I won’t say that I have learned yet– because it’s still a process that I’m going through.,['Declarative Clause']
I treat you as I would treat my son,['Declarative Clause']
 And our relationship is beyond belief.,['Declarative Clause']
 We live next door to one another.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. So you can see what I’m doing– you know first hand. ,['Declarative Clause']
We actually bump into each other all the time leaving in and out of the house,['Declarative Clause']
Uh-huh…,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, our conversations, they come from ”Boy, how come you ain’t called over here to check on me in a couple of days",['Declarative Clause']
You ain’t even asked me if I need my garbage to go out!”,['Declarative Clause']
Uh-huh.,['Declarative Clause']
I find those things funny because it’s a relationship with a mother for real. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, my natural son is no longer here",['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t see him graduate,['Declarative Clause']
Now you’re going to college,['Declarative Clause']
I’ll have the opportunity to see you graduate,['Declarative Clause']
 I didn’t see him getting married,['Declarative Clause']
"Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to experience that with you",['Declarative Clause']
Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation,['Declarative Clause']
 It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.,['Declarative Clause']
You still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you– it’s amazing. ,['Declarative Clause']
"I know it’s not an easy thing, you know, to be able to share our story together.",['Declarative Clause']
"Even with us sitting here looking at each other right now, I know it’s not an easy thing",['Declarative Clause']
So I admire that you can do this.,['Declarative Clause']
"I love you, lady.",['Declarative Clause']
" I love you too, son.",['Declarative Clause']
After that interview aired on NPR… Mary and Oshea continued sharing their story far beyond Minneapolis.,['Declarative Clause']
"They hit the road… visiting churches, synagogues, and prisons…=",['Declarative Clause']
We were invited to a lot of different places.,['Declarative Clause']
"We’ve had a lot of moments, us walking through the airports together, trying to figure out where we’re going",['Declarative Clause']
"And as we share our story, we still get to hear each other’s parts which brings us even more closer",['Declarative Clause']
"And it seemed like the mission kind of took off, even to the point where it grew its own legs and started running.",['Declarative Clause']
They were on every national media outlet you can think of and international too.,['Declarative Clause']
She spoke at conferences around the world on love and forgiveness and met with world leaders.,['Declarative Clause']
 President Barack Obama even thanked her for her service.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all because of how Mary has helped other families who have lost children to homicide. ,['Declarative Clause']
"She started an organization in 2005 called From Death to Life… that provides healing groups for mothers on both sides of a tragedy, and encourages forgiveness when mothers are ready.",['Declarative Clause']
: And through her work… she met the love of her life… a man named Ed Roy. ,['Declarative Clause']
"When my first-born and my one and only son was murdered, my daughters had asked me to go to the church to hear you speak.",['Declarative Clause']
"I wasn’t ready for the forgiveness part, but I was at a loss.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like I shared with you, I thought God took my boy and was punishing me for my own crimes",['Declarative Clause']
 I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old.,['Declarative Clause']
"But with you being there, I saw hope. ",['Declarative Clause']
You took me under your wing; that’s why I called you my angel.,['Declarative Clause']
"Then I remember, I had that dream — that was just before our wedding",['Declarative Clause']
"And your son was saying, ”Yeah, Mom! Alright!” You know, ”Right on!",['Declarative Clause']
"nd my son was saying, ”Yeah, Dad. ‘Bout time you got it right!”",['Declarative Clause']
"As the years and time goes by, you know where I’ve been",['Declarative Clause']
You know where I hurt.,['Declarative Clause']
And I know you take care of me when I’m not doing well.,['Declarative Clause']
The anniversary is coming up of my son’s murder and I’m grateful to have someone there that has experienced the same thing that I have.,['Declarative Clause']
That empty hole is always going to be there in our hearts.,['Declarative Clause']
"But I feel like when we together and we able to listen to one another’s heartbeats, it says a lot",['Declarative Clause']
I’m thankful; I really am.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re a good man.,['Declarative Clause']
They recorded that interview in 2017,['Declarative Clause']
"But recently, Ed has had to care for Mary in an entirely different way.",['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Declarative Clause']
 10 years after we first met Mary… she was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia… sometimes described as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s all rolled into one.,['Declarative Clause']
"And her husband, Ed, has been her main caretaker.",['Declarative Clause']
Just a few months ago… the two of them sat down for another interview.,['Declarative Clause']
There was a lot of things that neither one of us didn’t understand,['Declarative Clause']
"It was things like leaving something on the stove, parking your car a few houses down the street. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And as it progressed, we started understanding together what we was up against.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like, when you started seeing things — the invisible people.",['Declarative Clause']
"And we talked about it, honey",['Declarative Clause']
" You know, we made humor out of them",['Declarative Clause']
We call them the little people,['Declarative Clause']
Like when you had several bowls of cereal out and you was feeding them.,['Declarative Clause']
" And I said, “You giving all my Cap’n Crunch to the little people.",['Declarative Clause']
 What about me?”,['Declarative Clause']
"And you started laughing, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
We have so many moments.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I need to write them down. ",['Declarative Clause']
 They are written down,['Declarative Clause']
"They are written down in our hearts, honey.",['Declarative Clause']
Sometimes I think about when people say that a mind is a terrible thing to waste,['Declarative Clause']
…to waste. yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
But you know what?,['Declarative Clause']
The heart is the terrible thing to waste.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, don’t think about just the memory things; we’re here to remember for each other",['Declarative Clause']
 Don’t worry about the reading because I’m here and read to you. ,['Declarative Clause']
How many men would do the things that you do as far as taking care of me? ,['Declarative Clause']
Like putting on my shoes today.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s what it’s all about.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, it’s about us taking care of one another. ",['Declarative Clause']
"ou’ve given me, Mary, a reason for living. ",['Declarative Clause']
"I always told you that, though.",['Declarative Clause']
Uh-huh.,['Declarative Clause']
So that’s what I see you doing and giving to other people is hope,['Declarative Clause']
You have to have some kind of hope to hold on to,['Declarative Clause']
"When you don’t have that, you don’t have nothing. ",['Declarative Clause']
"So, it’s true",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s true what they say about when, uh, when they say wait on God, that he’ll send you that person",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, he knew what was in my heart.",['Declarative Clause']
 Wow. I love you.,['Declarative Clause']
I love you.,['Declarative Clause']
When word of Mary’s illness started to circulate among the families she’s helped… that’s when the visits we told you about earlier began…,['Declarative Clause']
You’ve got a full slate of visitors for today. ,['Declarative Clause']
Why are you saying somebody wants to come and sit and talk to me?,['Declarative Clause']
"Oh Mary, the world would be lined up if they were invited",['Declarative Clause']
That’s Brian Mogren,['Declarative Clause']
"One of Mary’s close friends and the Director of the St. Jane House, where Mary’s healing groups have been meeting for more than 15 years.",['Declarative Clause']
He started hosting “Thursdays with Mary” … so family and friends… including those Mary has helped… can now help her remember her impact.,['Declarative Clause']
 And at Mary’s request… Brian’s been recording these conversations.,['Declarative Clause']
" When I saw Brian’s note about meeting with you on Thursdays, I’m like, Oh, let me get my name on that list. Cause I want to see my friend.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. I’m so glad that you did,['Declarative Clause']
 That’s Mary’s longtime friend Gwen Chandler.,['Declarative Clause']
"Baby, you will never have any idea how much you’ve influenced people’s lives",['Declarative Clause']
And people will be saying your name for generations and generations. ,['Declarative Clause']
" I met someone recently, her brother was murdered when she was younger, and she wants to meet the person who killed her brother",['Declarative Clause']
Michele Braley is a social worker who was also with Mary at the prison the day that Mary met Oshea,['Declarative Clause']
And they’ve been friends ever since…,['Declarative Clause']
"And she said, partly, she had the courage to do that because she knew of your story and that you met Oshea",['Declarative Clause']
She’s never met you but you gave her courage,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, we don’t know all the lives we impact, do we?",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, but I wanted to get a chance to tell you that, Mary.",['Declarative Clause']
And despite her illness…,['Declarative Clause']
Mary’s still been helping to run her healing group for mothers every other Saturday…,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Constance Styles and my son Dante Gray was murdered in 1994.,['Declarative Clause']
 Well I’m Ebony Robinson.,['Declarative Clause']
"My son’s name is Andre Riley Jr and I lost him July 3rd, 2016.",['Declarative Clause']
"My son was murdered in 2016, December 25th. ",['Declarative Clause']
My name is Angel Cradle.,['Declarative Clause']
The loss of my son Dewayne Tyson Sr. happened in 2007 and the loss of my grandson Dewayne Tyson Jr. happened in 2018,['Declarative Clause']
"My name is Ann and my son, Maurice Wilson, was killed October the sixth, 1997",['Declarative Clause']
" My name is Princess Titus and my son, Anthony Titus, was hit by a bullet intended for another child two weeks after his 16th birthday, right before the fireworks on July 4th, 2010",['Declarative Clause']
Some of the mothers who were there this particular day… turned the tables on Mary…,['Declarative Clause']
"Do you mind if we spend some time sharing with you, Mother Mary, what you mean to us?",['Declarative Clause']
Ok. Amen,['Declarative Clause']
All right.,['Declarative Clause']
Amen.,['Declarative Clause']
I remember calling Mary around Mother’s Day.,['Declarative Clause']
" She said, this is just how it gets around Mother’s Day and holidays are gonna be like that.",['Declarative Clause']
So to have a woman who did walk that walk to let me know that I was not crazy and that we were not alone.,['Declarative Clause']
Loneliness doesn’t help grief and Mary did not allow us to be lonely. ,['Declarative Clause']
"So we’re forever grateful to you, Ms. Mary",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s not a happy situation, but we are blessed to be able to have you as our shepherd.",['Declarative Clause']
"Ooh, sister Mary, you mean the world to me.",['Declarative Clause']
I admire you so much,['Declarative Clause']
"o matter how hard things have been for you lately, you are still here teaching us and showing us what true love is. ",['Declarative Clause']
I think we all in tears around the table now,['Declarative Clause']
" So Mary, thank you for modeling… shining your little light everywhere you go.",['Declarative Clause']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Declarative Clause']
"Love you, ladies",['Declarative Clause']
We love you.,['Declarative Clause']
"Appreciate you so much, you don’t know.",['Declarative Clause']
But for all that’s happened over the past year… there was one person who hadn’t had this kind of conversation with Mary yet… Oshea,['Declarative Clause']
Her illness has affected him too,['Declarative Clause']
 It’s hard to see this woman who has meant so much to him declining.,['Declarative Clause']
"She’s not able to travel anymore or share their story together, which was such a big part of his life.",['Declarative Clause']
It gave him purpose,['Declarative Clause']
" So as much as she still means to him, he’s been hesitant to talk with her directly about her health.",['Declarative Clause']
"But finally, this summer, Oshea decided to sit down with Mary again… and StoryCorps was there to record it.",['Declarative Clause']
" Well Mary, it’s been 12 years since we sat down for our first StoryCorps interview and it’s more emotional for me this time",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, with everything that we’ve been through and we’ve dealt with and everything that’s going on now. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, it hurts to see",['Declarative Clause']
 I’m used to the lady that fusses at me all the time,['Declarative Clause']
But you’re strong and you’re going to fight for whatever you believe in,['Declarative Clause']
And I still see you fighting.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m glad to see you,['Declarative Clause']
I’m glad to see how you’re doing,['Declarative Clause']
So I thank God for that chance today.,['Declarative Clause']
A lot has changed.,['Declarative Clause']
"I, myself, have two children: my son, he’s three",['Declarative Clause']
And a little girl.,['Declarative Clause']
She’s how old now?,['Interrogative Clause']
She’s six years old now.,['Declarative Clause']
 I remember when she was born you helped me get the car seat for her,['Declarative Clause']
"ut since we were living next door to each other, you left me for another fella.",['Declarative Clause']
His name is Ed,['Declarative Clause']
I remember when I first got wind of you and Ed going out on dates.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m like, wait, what’s going on?",['Declarative Clause']
You was mine.,['Declarative Clause']
"But you all blessed me with the opportunity to not only be present in the wedding but to walk you down the aisle, that was, like, again, your words: beyond belief. ",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. I’m proud of you.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve been proud for a while.  ,['Declarative Clause']
It has been an amazing journey,['Declarative Clause']
"From a hug to you becoming a grandmother through me with my kids, to you just being a beacon of light to a lot of people.",['Declarative Clause']
"On our last interview we ended it with me saying “I love you, lady.” ",['Declarative Clause']
Mary’s still living at home with Ed… and goes to a daytime memory care center three times a week.,['Declarative Clause']
Brian has set up a GoFundMe to help support them,['Declarative Clause']
But one thing is clear… even as Mary’s memory dims… her light does not.,['Declarative Clause']
" This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine, yeah.",['Declarative Clause']
This little light of mine…,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I’m gonna let it shine.",['Declarative Clause']
"Let it shine, let it shine.",['Declarative Clause']
Let it shine,['Declarative Clause']
Everywhere I go,['Declarative Clause']
Everywhere I go… ,['Declarative Clause']
I’m gonna let it shine… ,['Declarative Clause']
 I’m gonna let it shine… ,['Declarative Clause']
Yes…,['Declarative Clause']
"Everywhere I go, I’m gonna let it shine. ",['Declarative Clause']
Everywhere…,['Declarative Clause']
Everywhere I go… ,['Declarative Clause']
I’m gonna let it shine…,['Declarative Clause']
Let it shine.,['Declarative Clause']
Let it shine,['Declarative Clause']
 Let it shine. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, Jesus gave it to me, yeah he did",['Declarative Clause']
’m gonna let it shine.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah Jesus gave it to me, I’m gonna let it shine",['Declarative Clause']
"Jesus gave it to me, and I’m gonna let it shine",['Declarative Clause']
 Let it shine,['Declarative Clause']
Let it shine.,['Declarative Clause']
Let it shine.,['Declarative Clause']
This episode was produced by Jasmyn Morris and Jud Esty-Kendall,['Declarative Clause']
 Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd,['Declarative Clause']
Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer,['Declarative Clause']
"Special thanks to Ian Gonzalez, Gaspar Caro, Liyna Anwar, Roselyn Almonte and especially…Brian Mogren",['Declarative Clause']
Without him..none of these recordings would have been possible,['Declarative Clause']
"Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website",['Declarative Clause']
"There, you can learn more about recording your own interview",['Declarative Clause']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. ,['Declarative Clause']
Join us again next week for our final episode… as we wrap up this special series…,['Declarative Clause']
"As always, thanks for listening.",['Declarative Clause']
" We’ve mentioned a lot of numbers over the past few episodes… 27,000 interviews on the mobile tour… 17,000 interviews in just one day when we released the app",['Declarative Clause']
But StoryCorps doesn’t just care about numbers… \n ,['Declarative Clause']
WHO records interviews is just as important as how many we collect,['Declarative Clause']
 If we’re building an archive of American voices… we need to make sure that the archive reflects who actually lives here in the United States,['Declarative Clause']
So while StoryCorps is open to anyone who wants to do an interview… we’ve worked to make sure that stories and voices that don’t often get included in the historical record ARE captured in the StoryCorps archive.,['Declarative Clause']
We call these efforts “initiatives”… you’ve heard about one already – StoryCorps Griot.,['Declarative Clause']
"There’s been quite a lot… like, Historias… or Military voices…",['Declarative Clause']
Our 9/11 initiative ,['Declarative Clause']
We did one for people with Memory Loss…,['Declarative Clause']
…and another inviting immigrants to record…,['Declarative Clause']
But on this episode… we’re going to focus on just one of the many that we’ve done… our collection of LGBTQ voices… called StoryCorps OutLoud… ,['Declarative Clause']
To be in the service for my country is the greatest thing I thought I did but I was kicked out for being homosexual.,['Declarative Clause']
When I first came out they didn’t have the words that they have today.,['Declarative Clause']
"So, attempting to tell your extraordinarily loving blue-collar parents that you were transgender was tantamount to telling them I was from Jupiter.",['Declarative Clause']
"We got married at the veterans home and we said, ’If you came to see the bride, you’re out of luck!’",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember that?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yes, of course!",['Declarative Clause']
 I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
nd I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Declarative Clause']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.\n ,['Declarative Clause']
"So we thought if we’re telling the story of StoryCorps this season, recording and sharing stories from LGTBQ folks has always been a part of that work and so why is that built into your fabric as a documentary radio producer and the founder of StoryCorps?",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s always been an issue that’s, you know, close to my heart.",['Declarative Clause']
 I’m the proud son of a gay dad. ,['Declarative Clause']
That’s Dave Isay… Jasmyn recently sat down with him to talk about the origins of OutLoud.,['Declarative Clause']
"My dad was named Richard Isay, and he was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst",['Declarative Clause']
"For many years, he saw only gay patients and was kind of a revolutionary in the psychoanalytic world in saying that homosexuality was not a disease and advocating in the work he did for helping LGBTQ folks find love",['Declarative Clause']
 So that was his mission in life.,['Declarative Clause']
I accidentally discovered he was gay when I was 21 and our nuclear family exploded,['Declarative Clause']
"Despite, you know, many hints and clues, I was taken completely by surprise.",['Declarative Clause']
" And I was really unhappy about a lot of things, uh, and confused about a lot of things.",['Declarative Clause']
And I withdrew from my dad for a while and it was about that time that I started making radio documentaries.  ,['Declarative Clause']
"At some point after my dad came out, he did tell me the story of the Stonewall riots, which I knew nothing about. ",['Declarative Clause']
And it was just a year or two later that I made my first radio documentary and I decided to make it on Stonewall.,['Declarative Clause']
" It was the first oral history of people who had been at Stonewall, believe it or not.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember on that night, when we saw the riot police, all of us drag queens, we linked arms like the Rockettes and sang the song we used to sing.",['Declarative Clause']
 “We are the village girls. ,['Declarative Clause']
We wear our hair in curls. ,['Declarative Clause']
We wear our dungarees above our nelly-knees” and the police went crazy hearing that and they just immediately rushed us.,['Declarative Clause']
 We gave one kick and fled.,['Declarative Clause']
 A lot of these folks had never been interviewed before about what had happened on that day.,['Declarative Clause']
 And I was very interested in what life was like before Stonewall.,['Declarative Clause']
"Sylvia Rivera, who’s kind of known as the Rosa Parks of the Stonewall movement, became one of my best friends and was the centerpiece of this radio documentary, which was named Remembering Stonewall, and I dedicated it to my dad.",['Declarative Clause']
 The era before Stonewall was a hard era. ,['Declarative Clause']
"There was always the gay bashings on the drag queens by heterosexual men, women, and the police",['Declarative Clause']
" We learned to live with it because it was part of the lifestyle at that time, I guess, but none of us were very happy about it.",['Declarative Clause']
" In some ways, was that you trying to figure out this time in your life where there was a secret, like, life before your dad coming out?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. I was very interested to understand what he had gone through,['Declarative Clause']
" And, you know, once he came out, I had found out things like, you know, he had been entrapped in a restroom, and he had to beg the cops not to put his name in the paper and, you know, destroy his life.",['Declarative Clause']
"And he had been a rising star in the world of psychoanalysts, and that star was completely extinguished the minute he came out.",['Declarative Clause']
"He was shunned and, you know, refused positions and he was very moved by the fact that I had made this documentary. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, it was me making an effort to understand him",['Declarative Clause']
"And, um, that was the beginning of our rebuilding our relationship with each other.",['Declarative Clause']
"Many, many, many years after that, I started StoryCorps",['Declarative Clause']
 And I guess you could say that there was something about not being crazy about secrets in our lives that was part of the motivation behind starting StoryCorps – giving people the chance to say the important things to the people who are most important to us,['Declarative Clause']
And that included Dave,['Declarative Clause']
Here he is talking with his dad in 2004….,['Declarative Clause']
What truly was the happiest moment of your life? ,['Interrogative Clause']
I think I am happier now than I’ve ever been in my life,['Declarative Clause']
"So it’s, um, happiness is a continuing process. ",['Declarative Clause']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
Where am I going?,['Interrogative Clause']
 I don’t think much about that. ,['Interrogative Clause']
You think about dying? ,['Interrogative Clause']
 All the time. ,['Declarative Clause']
 Are you scared of dying? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
" It’s, uh, it’s more an absence of that. ",['Declarative Clause']
What do you think is the most important thing that you’ve accomplished in your life?,['Interrogative Clause']
 What are you proudest of? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Very proud of you kids.,['Declarative Clause']
I am very proud of the work I’ve done and I am proud of being able to turn my life around and make it into a happy and good one.,['Declarative Clause']
Were you unhappy when I was a kid? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I think I was happy when you were a kid",['Declarative Clause']
And I was a good father and I loved having kids,['Declarative Clause']
You think I was a good father? ,['Interrogative Clause']
 I think you were a good father. ,['Declarative Clause']
You’re still a good father.,['Declarative Clause']
My dad got sick in 2012 on a Friday,['Declarative Clause']
 He was diagnosed with cancer and he died the next week,['Declarative Clause']
"And he actually died on the anniversary of Stonewall on June 28th, 2012.",['Declarative Clause']
"At the memorial service, I announced that in honor of my dad, we would be recording stories of people who were alive before Stonewall and that’s where it all began.",['Declarative Clause']
" And then, you know how I am— ",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m like a dog with a piece of steak, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
"After my dad died, there was no way that this thing wasn’t gonna get done, if it killed me",['Declarative Clause']
"And you know, that’s the way I, I guess, that I deal with, you know, grief or, or any issues, is that I just stay focused on StoryCorps and get something new done.",['Declarative Clause']
"I decided, you know, come hell or high water, we were going to do this program, which we named OutLoud. ",['Declarative Clause']
It launched in June 2014…,['Declarative Clause']
LGTBQ people from all walks of life came in to tell stories of love… loss… resiliency and creativity… and… family. ,['Declarative Clause']
 So in keeping with Dave’s story… we’re spending this episode hearing conversations about family… ,['Declarative Clause']
This first one is set in a small farming town in Washington State… where Patrick Haggerty was growing up in the 1950s,['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps he told his daughter, Robin, about something that happened in high school. ",['Declarative Clause']
There was an assembly that day and Patrick was going to perform. \n ,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m riding to school with my oldest brother, and on the way to school, I’m putting glitter all over my face",['Declarative Clause']
"And my brother said, ”What in the hell are you doing?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, ”I’m putting on my costume.”",['Declarative Clause']
" And he said, ”Well, I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing that.” ",['Declarative Clause']
"So he dropped me off at the school, and he called my dad up, and he said, ”Dad, I think you better get up there.",['Declarative Clause']
 This is not going to look good.” ,['Declarative Clause']
So my dad drove up to the high school,['Declarative Clause']
". And he had his farmer jeans on and they had cow crap on them, and he had his clodhopper boots on.",['Declarative Clause']
" And when I saw him coming, I ducked around the hall and hid from him.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it wasn’t because of what I was wearing, it was because of what he was wearing.  \n ",['Declarative Clause']
"So, the assembly goes well, and I climb in the car and I’m riding home with my father. ",['Declarative Clause']
"My father says to me, ”I was walking down the hall this morning, and I saw a kid that looked a lot like you ducking around the hall to avoid his dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I know it wasn’t you, cause you would never do that to your dad.”",['Declarative Clause']
" And I squirmed in my seat, and I finally busted out and I said, ”Well dad, did you have to wear your cow-crap jeans to my assembly?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And he said, ”Look, everybody knows I’m a dairy farmer. ",['Declarative Clause']
This is who I am.”,['Declarative Clause']
And he looked me square in the eye,['Declarative Clause']
"And then he said, ”Now, how bout you?",['Declarative Clause']
"When you’re a full-grown man, who are you gonna go out with at night?",['Declarative Clause']
" And I said, ”I don’t know.” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And he said, ”I think you do know, and it’s not gonna be that McGlaughlin girl that’s been making goo-goo eyes at you but you won’t even pick up the damn telephone.”",['Declarative Clause']
"“Now, I’m gonna tell you something today, and you might not know what to think of it now, but you’re gonna remember when you’re an adult. ",['Declarative Clause']
Don’t sneak.,['Declarative Clause']
" Because if you sneak, like you did today, it means you think you’re doing the wrong thing",['Declarative Clause']
"And if you run around spending your whole life thinking that you’re doing the wrong thing, then you’ll ruin your immortal soul.",['Declarative Clause']
"And out of all the things a father in 1959 could have told his gay son, my father tells me to be proud of myself and not sneak. ",['Declarative Clause']
My reaction at the time was to get out in the hay field and pretend like I was as much of a man as I could be,['Declarative Clause']
"And I remember flipping 50-pound bales three feet up into the air going, ”I’m not a queer",['Declarative Clause']
 What’s he talking about?”,['Interrogative Clause']
But he knew where I was headed.,['Declarative Clause']
And he…he knew that making me feel bad about it in any way was the wrong thing to do,['Declarative Clause']
" I had the patron saint of dads for sissies, and no, I didn’t know at the time, but I know it now",['Declarative Clause']
"Patrick Haggerty remembering his father, Charles Edward Haggerty",['Declarative Clause']
 Patrick was the founder of Lavender Country – which he called the world’s first openly gay country band,['Declarative Clause']
He died in 2022.,['Declarative Clause']
How have you seen things change in the way that we talk about and the way we tell stories from the LGBTQ community?,['Declarative Clause']
" I remember when I did the Stonewall documentary, I was trying to get newspapers to cover it, and I called the major newspaper in New York and said, you know, “we have this documentary, the first oral history of Stonewall, would you like to do a story about it?”",['Declarative Clause']
" And they said, “we don’t do stories about those kinds of people.”",['Declarative Clause']
"I like to think that at StoryCorps, we just, you know, whisper truths in people’s ears.",['Declarative Clause']
And what we try and do is find stories that haven’t been told before that creep up behind you and help you see yourself and someone who you might have thought was very different than you,['Declarative Clause']
 And I think we’ve done that from the first days of StoryCorps,['Declarative Clause']
" So I think, you know, nothing’s changed.",['Declarative Clause']
" We just, do our best to, you know, help be the vehicle through which people can have their stories told to the world.",['Declarative Clause']
More of those stories coming… after the break.,['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Declarative Clause']
Welcome back – we’re listening to conversations from StoryCorps OutLoud… our initiative to collect and preserve the stories of LGBTQ people across the country.,['Declarative Clause']
M.J. Seide fell in love in the early 1990s,['Declarative Clause']
Her partner had already been married and raised children… even grandchildren…,['Declarative Clause']
"Which meant that M.J. suddenly became a grandma, too…",['Declarative Clause']
"Here she is with her 12-year-old granddaughter, Genna Alperin.",['Declarative Clause']
How has your life been different than what you thought it was gonna to be?,['Interrogative Clause']
I thought that my life was probably not one that was gonna be worth living.,['Declarative Clause']
"There was this hole that I had all of my life because, I never thought I’d be able to walk along the beach and hold somebody’s hand because I’m gay",['Declarative Clause']
"But, you know, when I fell in love with Mamommy, I knew that she was my soulmate. ",['Declarative Clause']
Do you know what I mean by that?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
 I’d never felt that way about anyone before.,['Declarative Clause']
" And um, after she had gotten her divorce from grandpa Jim, she was very upfront with your mom",['Declarative Clause']
" She told your mom that she was in love, and it was with a woman",['Declarative Clause']
 And that was the first time that anyone was proud to say that they loved me,['Declarative Clause']
 That made me the happiest I’d ever been in my life. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And then, when I got to know your mom and uncle Justin, I knew that I had hit paradise because I now have a family that I can wrap my arms around",['Declarative Clause']
Is there anything that you’ve never told me that you wanna tell me now?,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, you and I talk about most things but this is the first time that we’ve ever talked about the fact that I’m gay and I guess what I wanna ask you is, does it embarrass you to have a gay grandma?",['Declarative Clause']
No,['Interrogative Clause']
: No?,['Interrogative Clause']
It doesn’t really matter,['Declarative Clause']
 It doesn’t.,['Declarative Clause']
It just matters my relationship with you.,['Declarative Clause']
" I always tell you how much I love you, but I don’t know that you can really understand the depth of it, because you’re someone that I never thought would be in my life and I can’t imagine my life without you.",['Declarative Clause']
"You have always been a child that makes up her own mind and, I always knew that you were going to grow up to be a woman that we would all be very, very proud of.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, um",['Declarative Clause']
You’re one of my favorite grandmas,['Declarative Clause']
"You do, like, a lot of things with me like ride roller coasters and (GA & MS laugh) play poker (GA & MS laugh) I don’t know what life would be like without you here.",['Declarative Clause']
 I love you sweetheart.,['Declarative Clause']
Love you too.,['Declarative Clause']
OutLoud was started to preserve the stories of the pre-Stonewall generation while we still could… but as it’s continued… it’s also documented several other generations… including the youngest one…,['Declarative Clause']
"Gabe Lopez always knew he was a boy, even though his birth certificate said otherwise.",['Declarative Clause']
"When he was 8 years old, Gabe came to StoryCorps in Arizona, where he lives, with his mom Chris, and they talked about how a weekend at camp for transgender kids transformed his life.",['Declarative Clause']
 Do you remember when things really changed for you? ,['Interrogative Clause']
 We went to a camp,['Declarative Clause']
"And I met three best friends — Luke, Brock, and Cooper.",['Declarative Clause']
"They were all transgender like me, so they all wanted to be boys.",['Declarative Clause']
"And that was huge for you, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s why I say we’re bros.,['Declarative Clause']
We know each other.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you ever get scared about what it’s going to be like to grow up transgender?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I’ve been wondering if when I’m older, a lot of people will try to hurt me or something … or … ",['Declarative Clause']
Like if they find out you were born a girl and they have a problem with it? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Mhmm,['Interrogative Clause']
You think they might try to hurt you in some way? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
Were you ever worried about telling me that you were transgender? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes,['Declarative Clause']
Did you ever try to tell me and then change your mind? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Mmhmm,['Declarative Clause']
How many times do you think? ,['Exclamatory Clause']
"I think like, four times. ",['Declarative Clause']
Four times? ,['Interrogative Clause']
I was worried that you liked me as a girl. ,['Declarative Clause']
Because we used to have a lot of fun? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Mmhmm. ,['Declarative Clause']
Do we still have fun? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"So it doesn’t really matter if you’re a boy or a girl, right? ",['Interrogative Clause']
Mhhmm,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t know that you were dealing with that on your own.,['Declarative Clause']
"If I’d known I would have tried a little bit harder to have that conversation with you, and maybe start it myself. ",['Declarative Clause']
" Um, do you worry about me? ",['Interrogative Clause']
I worry about how other people might treat you.,['Declarative Clause']
 And it makes me upset to think about what you might have to go through. \n ,['Declarative Clause']
You amaze me every day,['Declarative Clause']
"And you can tell me anything, anytime, anywhere, and it won’t change how much I love you",['Declarative Clause']
I’ll always have your back. ,['Declarative Clause']
" Thank you, mom.",['Declarative Clause']
 That conversation was recorded on our mobile tour in 2015… ,['Declarative Clause']
"And just this year Gabe, who’s now 16 years old… came back for another conversation",['Declarative Clause']
" This time with his dad, Julio.",['Declarative Clause']
Did you ever feel jealous that it was my friends who taught me how to pee standing up? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I don’t think so.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I was like, “that takes some talent to be able to do that.”",['Declarative Clause']
"When I first talked to you guys about how I felt, I was young, obviously, but I didn’t know the consequences that people could have for coming out to their parents",['Declarative Clause']
"We always thought it was just kind of a phase and we told you that, right? ",['Interrogative Clause']
: Mm-hmm. ,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember saying that to you because it happened with my sister.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, my sister was very tomboyish and hanging out with the boys but I noticed something different in you. ",['Declarative Clause']
"So when you came out to us, it caught us by surprise, but it wasn’t a big surprise.",['Declarative Clause']
You know what I mean?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
" I was really happy that you guys were super supportive, because I know that not many kids get that.   ",['Declarative Clause']
"We’ve always loved you, no matter what. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Like one of the pictures that I cherish, you were in a dress, you were holding a, a toy gun mm-hmm",['Declarative Clause']
 And your Hulk shoes…,['Declarative Clause']
"… and I mean, you know,  even though that time was still kind of difficult for you.",['Declarative Clause']
I saw who Gabe was and who he was gonna become in the future. ,['Declarative Clause']
I’m always gonna be able to cherish that. ,['Declarative Clause']
How would you describe yourself today?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I’m really trying to up my art game, so I can be a tattoo artist",['Declarative Clause']
I bought you a tattoo gun.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then told you I can be your test dummy and I love it because, for your first tattoo on a person, that came out really good",['Declarative Clause']
What kind of man do you want to be?,['Interrogative Clause']
The kind of man that can help others see different viewpoints,['Declarative Clause']
And not specifically that they have to agree with that side but they acknowledge that it’s there,['Declarative Clause']
What are your hopes for me?,['Interrogative Clause']
I want you to be happy,['Declarative Clause']
When I leave here I want you to be OK,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all I’m wanting for you.,['Declarative Clause']
 I don’t think we have any idea what these stories…what this kind of collection of the wisdom of humanity is going to mean a hundred years from now,['Declarative Clause']
But it’s a way to pass wisdom from one generation to the next and it shows the best in us,['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s one of those, you know, those lessons of StoryCorps; just reminds us of the fundamental goodness of humanity. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And we have to trust in that, especially, when we go through rough times, like we’re going through today",['Declarative Clause']
"But you know, that’s a lesson going back to Stonewall and Sylvia Rivera and, you know, the heroes who fought on that night, that you just can’t give up.",['Declarative Clause']
And I do believe that good wins in the end. ,['Declarative Clause']

I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started.,['Declarative Clause']
And they would see me again around Christmas time,['Declarative Clause']
And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again.,['Declarative Clause']
"So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable.",['Declarative Clause']
And as far as you doing the business?,['Declarative Clause']
You started younger than me.,['Declarative Clause']
As soon as I could walk.,['Declarative Clause']
Even before you were walking.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I…",['Declarative Clause']
 I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.,['Declarative Clause']
I was literally there since day one.,['Declarative Clause']
"I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. ",['Declarative Clause']
"One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.",['Declarative Clause']
I have a sense of usefulness.,['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…",['Declarative Clause']
That comes from coming from immigrant parents. ,['Declarative Clause']
You can never work hard enough.,['Declarative Clause']
"Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.”",['Declarative Clause']
" Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Declarative Clause']
Never.,['Declarative Clause']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, never.",['Declarative Clause']
And when am I gonna retire?,['Interrogative Clause']
One day before your funeral? ,['Interrogative Clause']
You know it.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know if you ever didn’t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken. ",['Declarative Clause']
I would understand.,['Declarative Clause']
" Yeah, yeah.",['Declarative Clause']
You know what I mean?,['Declarative Clause']
"My father, he hated my business man.",['Declarative Clause']
" You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time.",['Declarative Clause']
I like that.,['Declarative Clause']
"But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.”",['Declarative Clause']
"You raised all of us, man.",['Declarative Clause']
"Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.,['Declarative Clause']
Well you do your best kid.,['Declarative Clause']
This is what you do. ,['Declarative Clause']
But honestly your best.,['Declarative Clause']
Not just your B.S. best. ,['Declarative Clause']
And even if you fail.,['Declarative Clause']
 It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re always my barometer.,['Declarative Clause']
You never let anyone down.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s what sets you apart.,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Rob Rigano. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Interrogative Clause']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately",['Declarative Clause']
Yes,['Declarative Clause']
 Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego.,['Declarative Clause']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Declarative Clause']
He came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.,['Declarative Clause']
"My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.  ",['Declarative Clause']
"What’s your earliest memory, Rob? ",['Interrogative Clause']
I rolled my Uncle Charlie’s Dodge into the street light.,['Declarative Clause']
"Wait, what happened?-",['Interrogative Clause']
"Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Declarative Clause']
 Into a telephone pole? ,['Interrogative Clause']
 Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled.,['Declarative Clause']
"He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.  ",['Declarative Clause']
"Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I fell out.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah?,['Interrogative Clause']
"And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, the locks were defected.",['Declarative Clause']
So you weren’t playing with the door handle? ,['Interrogative Clause']
No.,['Declarative Clause']
 I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.,['Declarative Clause']
I know you had trouble with the locks,['Declarative Clause']
And then another time I bit a horse. ,['Declarative Clause']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Declarative Clause']
I thought I did?,['Interrogative Clause']
"The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.”",['Declarative Clause']
Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years.,['Declarative Clause']
"Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping.",['Declarative Clause']
And he got to know nearly every resident. ,['Declarative Clause']
He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people.,['Declarative Clause']
In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?”",['Declarative Clause']
He just has that sense of what’s right,['Declarative Clause']
What’s your happiest memory? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim.",['Declarative Clause']
But my dad’s a little excitable. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Why do you think that is, Rob? ",['Interrogative Clause']
 I think that’s his nature. ,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"No no, that’s his nature. ",['Declarative Clause']
Rolling cars into trees?,['Interrogative Clause']
I don’t do that anymore. ,['Declarative Clause']
Oh okay,['Declarative Clause']
"I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?” ",['Declarative Clause']
"Because he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor.",['Declarative Clause']
He is not as effervescent as he used to be. ,['Declarative Clause']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together. ,['Declarative Clause']
He is a gem of a guy and we all helped polish him.,['Declarative Clause']
Anything else Rob?,['Interrogative Clause']
I think that’s about it. ,['Declarative Clause']
 That’s all? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. ,['Declarative Clause']
And next year we could have stories about you.,['Declarative Clause']
For 25 years… the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay… ,['Declarative Clause']
And if you called in the 1980s… longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone. ,['Declarative Clause']
At StoryCorps… she remembered what this work meant to her.,['Declarative Clause']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building.,['Declarative Clause']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. ",['Declarative Clause']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.",['Declarative Clause']
" It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy. ",['Declarative Clause']
But it was our place.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"You know, it was beautiful. ",['Exclamatory Clause']
"Typical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically?",['Declarative Clause']
"But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk… Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something.",['Declarative Clause']
‘Should I tell my parents? Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’ ,['Declarative Clause']
"The suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that",['Declarative Clause']
I had a few of those calls.,['Declarative Clause']
"‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s all we could say, really.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.",['Declarative Clause']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Declarative Clause']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14",['Declarative Clause']
" And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him",['Declarative Clause']
And my mother,['Interrogative Clause']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Declarative Clause']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters. ,['Declarative Clause']
"So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore",['Declarative Clause']
" You know, and I was still like just a kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted",['Declarative Clause']
But that wasn’t who I was. ,['Declarative Clause']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s what people wanted to hear. ,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone. ",['Declarative Clause']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Declarative Clause']
"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you.",['Declarative Clause']
And you bent over and kissed me on the head,['Declarative Clause']
"It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.",['Declarative Clause']
And I felt that things really would be OK.,['Declarative Clause']
"When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died",['Declarative Clause']
 And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person,['Declarative Clause']
"Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’",['Declarative Clause']
And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter.",['Declarative Clause']
I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.",['Declarative Clause']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019,['Declarative Clause']
"After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.",['Declarative Clause']
My relationship with you is very important to me. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And when I met you, it made me feel so much better. ",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Interrogative Clause']
"To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another… And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.",['Declarative Clause']
It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had. ,['Declarative Clause']
It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.,['Declarative Clause']
"We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends.",['Declarative Clause']
And we had that book at her funeral service.,['Declarative Clause']
"So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief…",['Declarative Clause']
Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us.,['Declarative Clause']
And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.",['Declarative Clause']
And that was in a big way John.,['Declarative Clause']
I almost feel like you’re a brother.,['Declarative Clause']
I suspect our mothers have something to do with that.,['Declarative Clause']
They might quite well,['Declarative Clause']
"Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think",['Declarative Clause']
 So what a gift they gave us.,['Declarative Clause']
They certainly did.,['Declarative Clause']
"Let’s go back one more time to one of Dave Isay’s early appearances on the Brian Lehrer show, in New York City. ",['Declarative Clause']
This one is from 2004…,['Declarative Clause']
"We’re trying to create an oral history of America from the bottom up and that’s what we’re getting, everyday people, just regular people talking in the booth and it’s been incredibly gratifying.",['Declarative Clause']
"And so I know you’re a big-think kind of guy, what’s the larger impact that you hope this will have on America if your vision really succeeds in getting a lot of people around America doing this?",['Interrogative Clause']
 It’s a project about getting people to listen to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
" I mean, we live in such a culture of, you know, even when you look at the best seller list, you’ve got these books that are all the way on the right and all the way on the left",['Declarative Clause']
 And it just seems like everybody is screaming at each other.,['Declarative Clause']
There’s just this lack of real honest communication and it’s simply about getting people to sit down and talk to each other and listen.,['Declarative Clause']
So now you’re going to get diehard Democrats and diehard Republicans to the booth to really listen to each other about where their views come from?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Hey, you never know",['Declarative Clause']
You never know. ,['Declarative Clause']
 We hope so.,['Declarative Clause']
20 years ago… that sounded like a whimsical idea… ,['Declarative Clause']
But that comment would end up being kind of prophetic,['Declarative Clause']
"In the years since that interview, the divides in this country have grown wider… and the stakes have gotten much, much higher.",['Declarative Clause']
Listen to this StoryCorps participant named John Klinkel… he’s a veteran and he did multiple tours in Afghanistan… ,['Declarative Clause']
I was out of the country from 2009 until about March of 2017,['Declarative Clause']
". When I got back, the country was almost as angry as some of the factions I remember seeing in Afghanistan.",['Declarative Clause']
" It felt like a country that was always on the verge of either tearing itself, apart or picking a fight.",['Declarative Clause']
 And I didn’t remember that from when I left.,['Declarative Clause']
 So it was very strange for me to come back and feel the anger.,['Declarative Clause']
"If you think of being in a deployed environment, you want to stay in the yellow light, cautious, ready to go but recognizing that things haven’t jumped off just yet.",['Declarative Clause']
And it kind of felt like that,['Declarative Clause']
"It felt like, Ooh, we’re in a situation here",['Declarative Clause']
Who knows what’s going to happen.,['Declarative Clause']
Whenever there’s a national crisis or tragedy of some sort… StoryCorps has always tried to find ways to be helpful.,['Declarative Clause']
"When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks",['Declarative Clause']
 We offered families who had lost someone that day the opportunity to record their memories… to make sure their loved ones wouldn’t be forgotten.,['Declarative Clause']
 In earlier episodes you heard about how we brought a Mobile Booth to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina…,['Declarative Clause']
And how we built new technology to help connect people during Covid.,['Declarative Clause']
And so in this final episode we’ll learn what StoryCorps is doing NOW… ,['Declarative Clause']
And where we might go in the future… I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Declarative Clause']
"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now – celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
hat clip youjust  heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US… that’s from an initiative called One Small Step,['Declarative Clause']
Our effort to address just how divided we’ve become.,['Declarative Clause']
 It brings strangers with opposing political beliefs together for a conversation – not to argue about politics… but just to learn about each other’s lives.,['Declarative Clause']
We don’t expect them to or even want them or ask them to agree by the end of the conversation. ,['Declarative Clause']
That’s Mary Bess Ser…. she works on One Small Step. ,['Declarative Clause']
 We’re not asking people to come to any sort of common ground,['Declarative Clause']
We just want people to talk. ,['Declarative Clause']
Because… we HAVE stopped talking to each other,['Declarative Clause']
. A lot of us have a tendency to shut out people we don’t agree with… so One Small Step asks us to do the opposite… to actually get to know each other. ,['Declarative Clause']
"The basis of the whole conversation is, you know, yes, we probably disagree on most things, but we’re having this conversation anyway.",['Declarative Clause']
"And by the end of it, We’ll see what happens.  ",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, these days the voices telling us that we’re supposed to hate each other are so loud… and so pervasive… One Small Step really feels like David taking on Goliath… but we’ve never shied from a challenge before…",['Declarative Clause']
And there’s scientific evidence that something like this can make a difference,['Declarative Clause']
 One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.,['Declarative Clause']
The idea is that under very specific circumstances… when people who consider themselves enemies are put together one on one… they can actually come out the other side of that experience understanding and accepting each other… and sometimes they even become friends. ,['Declarative Clause']
One of the keys is that phrase “very specific circumstances” – so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.,['Declarative Clause']
Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other… but One Small Step interviews are between strangers.,['Declarative Clause']
Here’s Mary Bess again…,['Declarative Clause']
The fact that they’re strangers really makes it less threatening.,['Declarative Clause']
 So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother – that may or may not be my story –  it’s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there’s no relationship at stake,['Declarative Clause']
You come to the table with a clean slate.  ,['Declarative Clause']
Here’s how it works – people sign up online – there’s a questionnaire that asks them to rate how they feel about social and economic issues… how important religion is in their lives…,['Declarative Clause']
"hey can select from a list of terms to identify themselves… things like parent, grandparent or veteran.",['Declarative Clause']
And they write a short bio… describing themselves in their own words – and that gets shared with their interview partner. ,['Declarative Clause']
 Then someone from StoryCorps – like Mary Bess – matches them up with a stranger. ,['Declarative Clause']
There’s a real person doing the pairing… not an algorithm.,['Declarative Clause']
 They don’t see the reason why we’ve matched them,['Declarative Clause']
" Really they show up to the interview, you know, not knowing at all what to expect, and usually people realize that they’ve come to the table with a lot of assumptions. ",['Declarative Clause']
 Here’s one example,['Declarative Clause']
" It comes from Birmingham, Alabama… where Cassandra Adams, a liberal, was paired with David Wilson, a conservative. ",['Declarative Clause']
" Lemme ask you this, when you read my bio…",['Declarative Clause']
 Mm-hmm.,['Declarative Clause']
What did you think?,['Interrogative Clause']
And please be as honest as you feel comfortable because nothing would bother me.,['Imperative Clause']
"Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype— ",['Declarative Clause']
 Mm-hmm.,['Declarative Clause']
"Second part was intriguing because you said something along the lines of an open mind and I thought, well this would be interesting.",['Declarative Clause']
When I read your bio I just thought you were a white man.,['Declarative Clause']
 I thought I was gonna come in here and just be like… ,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t even know what it was! I don’t remember what it was!,['Declarative Clause']
And that’s what’s so interesting to me!,['Declarative Clause']
 Is that I’m just like… ,['Declarative Clause']
Stereotype!,['Declarative Clause']
That’s exactly right!,['Exclamatory Clause']
"So I have to admit it because when you walked in the door and I stood up and introduce myself I was like ‘oops, oops, oops.’",['Declarative Clause']
"To have this opportunity to match people, like they’re dating, and there’s always some sort of coincidence that we didn’t even know about",['Declarative Clause']
"One interview, we found out that both participants, I mean, they couldn’t be more different, but they’re both foster parents, and we didn’t know that. ",['Declarative Clause']
"That wasn’t even a point of connection where I thought, oh, they’re so different, but they’re foster parents.",['Declarative Clause']
This will be a great conversation.,['Declarative Clause']
Nope. I didn’t even know.,['Declarative Clause']
 They had a great time,['Declarative Clause']
They wanted to go out for coffee afterwards.,['Declarative Clause']
": Yeah. I mean, that really is something, right?",['Declarative Clause']
"Because we’re told constantly, talking about the other side, like, oh, those people, we can’t possibly have anything in common with them, and then it’s amazing to hear that there’s almost always something.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, and it can be something completely uninteresting too it could be like, Oh, both of these people are into intermittent fasting, you know, like, (laughs) but they have something to talk about, you know, that, (laughs) and they realize that it’s the shared humanity aspect of it, you know",['Declarative Clause']
"Here’s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona. ",['Declarative Clause']
Their connection… was parenting,['Declarative Clause']
 I’ve been stretched and challenged far beyond I knew was possible,['Declarative Clause']
You know?,['Interrogative Clause']
" And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one?",['Interrogative Clause']
 Right?,['Interrogative Clause']
And your heart just seems to have all kinds of elastic in it.,['Declarative Clause']
 It doesn’t ever wear out.,['Declarative Clause']
 Right?,['Interrogative Clause']
 You know?,['Interrogative Clause']
Pretty amazing.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?,['Interrogative Clause']
That’s a great question,['Declarative Clause']
" My dad would say, “Well you can do that if you want",['Declarative Clause']
 I prefer this.”,['Declarative Clause']
 And he let us see that opportunity for ourselves.,['Declarative Clause']
I remember when I told him I wanted to try smoking cigarettes.,['Declarative Clause']
" And he said, “Well, I personally prefer to breathe clean air, but if that’s your choice, then you go for it” and took the excitement out of it.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, you actually told him that.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
That you had that relationship you could do that.,['Declarative Clause']
Yes,['Declarative Clause']
 I feel like I lean toward that with my children,['Declarative Clause']
You know I think what a gift your father gave you,['Declarative Clause']
So I’m very much a daddy’s girl,['Declarative Clause']
I connected with him,['Declarative Clause']
 He was my junior senior high school principal,['Declarative Clause']
So 7th through 12th grade,['Declarative Clause']
" And when I was going into 7th grade, you know, he made sure he had a conversation with me where he said, “You know, your mom and I think you’re pretty special but, because you’re my daughter, you’re probably going to have few friends and you probably won’t have anybody who will want to date you",['Declarative Clause']
"And it’s not because you don’t have a lot to offer, but it’s primarily because of whose daughter you are.”",['Declarative Clause']
"The fact that he did that, laid that out for a 12-year-old girl, he set the tone for me to know what the road was going to be like. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And we didn’t have a lot of conversations, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
" And I don’t know how often my father ever said I love you, but I know he loved me.",['Declarative Clause']
Who knew how that was going to go? ,['Declarative Clause']
"Like you said, it’s unscripted",['Declarative Clause']
" We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
 Like that.,['Declarative Clause']
 Let me give you a hug.,['Imperative Clause']
" A lot of people think that, Oh, one small step, these conversations, people are going to attack each other, you know, it’s going to get ugly",['Declarative Clause']
"And honestly, it’s the opposite. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Some people don’t want to participate because they say, well, I don’t really know, I’m not really well versed in what’s going on in politics right now.",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s where we say, you know, you don’t have to prepare for this experience.",['Declarative Clause']
"You don’t have to, this isn’t a debate. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You don’t need to bring a briefcase full of, you know, the most recent articles. you just bring your life experience and talk about what you care about, what your life has been like and listen to someone else do the same and that’s pretty much it.",['Declarative Clause']
So there ARE some other ways One Small Step interviews are different from standard StoryCorps conversations…,['Declarative Clause']
Each One Small Step interview starts with the participants reading each other’s bios out loud… ,['Declarative Clause']
And then a trained facilitator guides them through the conversation with questions from a list designed specifically for One Small Step. ,['Declarative Clause']
"One of the questions is can you describe in your own words, your personal political values?",['Interrogative Clause']
"The way it’s phrased you’re asked to talk about why you care about something, why it’s important to you, why you believe X, Y, or Z",['Declarative Clause']
So you’re still talking about your own life.,['Declarative Clause']
"You’re still telling stories, you know, how your grandfather influenced you, or, you know, you grew up poor.",['Declarative Clause']
It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
"And makes it about understanding, which is, like, a completely different approach ",['Declarative Clause']
" Yeah, I mean you can still walk out of the room and think, you know, that person everything they stand for is completely wrong, but, somehow, I enjoyed speaking with them, or somehow I kind of respect them. ",['Declarative Clause']
"This next conversation comes from Columbus, Georgia… Alton Russell is the former Chair of the Republican party there…",['Declarative Clause']
And he was paired with Wane Hailes… who was the President of the local chapter of the NAACP.,['Declarative Clause']
These guys knew of each other… but they had never spoken before this interview.,['Declarative Clause']
:  I went to Houston looking for a job in this little old bitty office.,['Declarative Clause']
There was a guy sitting at the desk.,['Declarative Clause']
"He said, um, “What will you do?” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Anything as long as it’s legal.” ",['Declarative Clause']
"He says, “Good answer. ",['Declarative Clause']
How about 40 dollars a week?”,['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Yes sir.”",['Declarative Clause']
This was 1961.,['Declarative Clause']
"He said, by the way, “My name is George Bush.”",['Declarative Clause']
It was George H. W. Bush. ,['Declarative Clause']
Really,['Declarative Clause']
"Yes, sir.",['Declarative Clause']
And he was running for Congress,['Declarative Clause']
What my job was is I made yard signs with a wooden stake and a piece of poster board and a stencil,['Declarative Clause']
But you’ve never run for office? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, never have. ",['Declarative Clause']
You’ve just been the kingmaker. ,['Declarative Clause']
" Well, I don’t know about that",['Declarative Clause']
"But I, no, I never have run. ",['Declarative Clause']
What do you do for a living?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Believe it or not, I’m a toilet paper salesman. ",['Declarative Clause']
Really? ,['Declarative Clause']
"Yes, sir. ",['Declarative Clause']
Two ply? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"Two ply, wipe it up, yeah",['Declarative Clause']
 I’ve been there 40 years. ,['Declarative Clause']
Is that right? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
"t you’ve done a lot of different things too, and I’m, I’m just wondering how in the world did you wind up in Columbus, Georgia? ",['Interrogative Clause']
Did you take a wrong turn? ,['Interrogative Clause']
" I was working for the YMCA, and the YMCA here called and said, “Would I be interested?” ",['Declarative Clause']
"But as the president of the NAACP, I can tell you how I got into that.",['Declarative Clause']
"When we were, uh, growing up, about 8 or 9 years old, we were traveling to my grandfather’s house and we stopped at a laundromat",['Declarative Clause']
" And when we went in,  they said, “We don’t wash black folks clothes here.” ",['Declarative Clause']
Mm-hmm.,['Declarative Clause']
"Of course, they didn’t use black folks word",['Declarative Clause']
" My father being a preacher, you know, he was cool, but my mother was ready to go off, you know, and we went on to my grandfather’s house and he got on the phone and he called the NAACP",['Declarative Clause']
"About 30 minutes later, they said, going back up to the laundromat.",['Declarative Clause']
"And the white owner stood in the corner while we washed our clothes, red as a beet",['Declarative Clause']
"So I’m like, Oh man, that was a memory that’s always been in my mind",['Declarative Clause']
Sure,['Declarative Clause']
And how it worked,['Declarative Clause']
You know what?,['Interrogative Clause']
 I have a good friend of mine,['Declarative Clause']
We went to breakfast one morning and when we left this guy that was in the restaurant with us came out and followed me to my truck,['Declarative Clause']
"nd he said, um, “Are you Alton Russell?” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Yes, I am.”",['Declarative Clause']
"He says, “Well, I saw you on TV the other day.”",['Declarative Clause']
"He said, “But I got a question. ",['Declarative Clause']
 How can you be a Republican and eat breakfast with that black guy?”,['Declarative Clause']
"I said, “What did you say?",['Declarative Clause']
That guy’s a friend of mine,['Declarative Clause']
You’re way off base.,['Declarative Clause']
" We got things to do, and worrying about whether you’re a man, a woman, black, or white is not what you need to be focusing on.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
"Well I’ll tell you what, I’ve got a whole different view of you",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, my perception was, okay, he’s always going to be over here.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m not going to even talk with him,['Declarative Clause']
" But this has been, this has been eye opening for me. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, it has to me too. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I can go tell some people, “Hey, Alton’s not that bad.”",['Declarative Clause']
 He’s alright. ,['Declarative Clause']
It’s been fun.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m really glad to have met you; I sure am.,['Declarative Clause']
People have come to believe that these conversations are possible,['Declarative Clause']
"So that in and of itself, I think, is an increase in hope.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I don’t know if you can quantify it, hope, but, um, you know, the belief that we can have these conversations, especially in an election year, you know, you wonder, well, is this the right time for one small step",['Interrogative Clause']
And I think it’s even more important at those times because that’s when we most definitely do not want to talk to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory,['Interrogative Clause']
That idea that if people from different groups come together 1 on 1… they can start to see each other as human?,['Declarative Clause']
One Small Step interviews are definitely helping that to happen,['Declarative Clause']
But the harder thing to make happen… is to have that feeling generalize… to not be just about that one individual you met… but about a whole group…,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, there’s a social psychologist at Yale, Jennifer Richeson… and she’s been studying One Small Step and the impact it’s having on participants…",['Declarative Clause']
And she’s finding evidence that… for some people who record with us… this feeling IS beginning to generalize.,['Declarative Clause']
"Sometimes people say, well, I didn’t see fireworks, it didn’t change me, but they really enjoyed the other person’s company and they were surprised by that, or They really felt like they understood each other and that really surprised them",['Declarative Clause']
It definitely chips away at that us versus them mentality just a little bit,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, that’s why we say it’s one small step.",['Declarative Clause']
 It’s not a magic cure. ,['Declarative Clause']
We’re not calling it that,['Declarative Clause']
 It’s just One Small Step in the right direction,['Declarative Clause']
We’ll be back… right after the break,['Declarative Clause']
 Stay with us…,['Declarative Clause']
"So, Jasmyn, here we are… the last segment of the final episode of this series.",['Declarative Clause']
We made it…,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, one of the big takeaways for me looking back on these past twenty years… it’s related to what Mary Bess said a few minutes ago… about increasing hope",['Declarative Clause']
"I think at its root, that’s a big part of what StoryCorps is about… and I don’t mean like cheap greeting card expressions of hope… but the kind of hope that grows out of hard work… and having people surprise you.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step",['Declarative Clause']
" Earlier this year, in a “Mr Isay Goes to Washington” moment… Dave brought One Small Step to the annual baseball game between members of Congress at Nationals stadium in DC… and he showed a video on the jumbotron challenging them to participate… and some of them actually did…",['Declarative Clause']
"And soon we’re rolling out this new do-it-yourself online version of One Small Step, so that strangers anywhere in the country can record an interview.",['Declarative Clause']
"You could have a person from the bluest county in America getting to know someone from the reddest county… I mean, for me personally at this moment in history… it’s just really incredible to work at a place where the underlying ethos is optimism.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah and I think for me having listened to A LOT of StoryCorps interviews over the years… and it’s really beautiful to hear someone take the time to sit down with another person, especially an elder to capture wisdom from their family…  you know, before it’s lost",['Declarative Clause']
"ut for those of who get to do this work… we’ve been able to listen to thousands of these interviews, thousands of  grandparents… or parents or couples and absorb basically generations of wisdom…",['Declarative Clause']
"And I don’t know if I’ve ever told you this but I actually used to keep a folder of little clips from interviews whenever I heard little gems … that I just wanted to keep for myself, stuff I could use in my own life. ",['Declarative Clause']
What a gift.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Very cool.,['Declarative Clause']
Another thing that strikes me is that after 20 years… the basic idea of a StoryCorps interview really hasn’t changed that much… and I mean that in the best way… it’s held up… like no matter what’s going on in the world… this way of taking an hour to connect with somebody… we want it… maybe we even need it.,['Declarative Clause']
And we found something that really helps illustrate that point.,['Declarative Clause']
We dug up the very first SC interview ever recorded… ,['Declarative Clause']
" I’m Dave Isay, and I’m interviewing Sandy Birnbaum, who’s my uncle, my great uncle.  ",['Declarative Clause']
Great Uncle. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Sandy, this is a very special session here because, like I said, we’re starting this whole national movement and you’re interview number one.",['Declarative Clause']
"When they spoke in 2003… Sandy’s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before. ",['Declarative Clause']
"The first date, she says, “I’ll meet you in the doorway just past the liquor store after work.” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I was standing in the doorway, and it’s inset a little bit",['Declarative Clause']
" And finally I see this vision of purple coming down the street, a purple hat and a purple coat, and I think she had purple shoes and stockings on, too and uh, it  was so glamorous.",['Declarative Clause']
" I says, What the hell am I, a two bit farm boy? ",['Declarative Clause']
This is such a sophisticated woman,['Declarative Clause']
" mean, she’s way beyond me",['Declarative Clause']
" So I turned to the doorway, and I tried to duck out, but the door was locked. ",['Declarative Clause']
"If the door was open, it would have ended there and the best thing that…",['Declarative Clause']
" Well anyhow, uh, the door was locked and, uh, we had just so much fun. ",['Declarative Clause']
 Birdie was the love of your life?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Oh yeah, yeah. ",['Declarative Clause']
 What did you love about her?  ,['Interrogative Clause']
ou know I’ve never been asked that question.,['Declarative Clause']
Just her warmth,['Declarative Clause']
 She was everything that I wasn’t,['Declarative Clause']
"She filled in all the, uh, deficiencies I had, which were considerable, mostly in regard to shyness and to, uh, self confidence and things like that.",['Declarative Clause']
"Everybody loved her, and she was a good person to have with you",['Declarative Clause']
"Oh God,  I remember…",['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, Sandy",['Declarative Clause']
So let me ask you a question,['Declarative Clause']
"It is helpful to talk about this, yeah? ",['Interrogative Clause']
 Uh,['Declarative Clause']
Or is it not?  ,['Interrogative Clause']
Is it damaging to bring up? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"Oh, no.. it’s a good feeling.",['Declarative Clause']
" Break out crying or you choke up and you can’t say a word, that’s a good feeling? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, it is.",['Declarative Clause']
"Because, you know, you don’t have to pretend that you’re being a brave soul.",['Declarative Clause']
Gutting it through,['Declarative Clause']
 It’s a good feeling,['Declarative Clause']
 Let me get you home. ,['Imperative Clause']
Okay,['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, Sandy",['Declarative Clause']
"As always, thanks for listening.",['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. ,['Declarative Clause']

"There, you can learn more about ALL the work we do…and how to add your story to the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered.",['Declarative Clause']
"Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website.",['Declarative Clause']
"Special thanks to Kerrie Hillman, Mary Bess Ser, Neil Griffith, and all our One Small Step partners… ",['Declarative Clause']

. Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Um, and I, you know, I hope that the ethos of StoryCorps, that the idea that all of our lives and all of our stories matter equally and infinitely, the idea that we should treat each other with respect, that nobody’s the worst thing they’ve they’ve ever done, that people should be given a second chance that it flows through the veins of the country and participating in StoryCorps and listening to StoryCorps stories becomes part of what it means to be an American and that StoryCorps grows into an institution that outlives us all.",['Declarative Clause']
"Some people have said to me over the years that, you know, if aliens came to earth and they could only find one thing, they hoped it would be the StoryCorps archive because it really, it shows the best in us, but it also shows who we really are and that is the best in us.",['Declarative Clause']
"So what are your hopes for the future, for the next 20 years?",['Interrogative Clause']
"But, um, you know, it’s been worth every bit of it, and I’m incredibly grateful to the staff who helped make this dream come true.  ",['Declarative Clause']
" You know, truer words have never been spoken",['Declarative Clause']
And when he left he said at his goodbye party that “StoryCorps is hard work and love work and blood work.,['Declarative Clause']
One of the original StoryCorps employees–we started with four or five–and one of them was a guy named Matt Ozug,['Declarative Clause']
" You know, but it’s drawn people who just refuse to give up and I think that’s part of the secret sauce and the magic of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
There’s nothing viral or easy about StoryCorps,['Declarative Clause']
And it’s very hard work,['Declarative Clause']
"But their, um, motto famously was, We answer to a higher authority and, you know, I think that’s how all of us have felt at StoryCorps over these past 20 years, that this is sacred work and it draws a very special person to do this work",['Declarative Clause']
I have absolutely no idea. ,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t know why. ,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, true story and kind of crazy, but our first corporate sponsor was Hebrew National Hot Dogs.",['Declarative Clause']
"The StoryCorps team has never ceased to amaze me and, you know, that’s why we are what we are. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, well, I mean I think that everybody when they leave StoryCorps to a person and, you know, we’ve had thousands of employees at this point over the years, you know, everyone says that the best thing about StoryCorps are the people",['Declarative Clause']
Lots of people have put their whole selves into this work.  ,['Declarative Clause']
Right,['Declarative Clause']
Me too.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’ve gotten married, had children in this time.",['Declarative Clause']
And we’ve all had life changes.,['Declarative Clause']
"So, for this last episode, looking back on twenty years, so many people have contributed to making StoryCorps what it is now, of course.",['Declarative Clause']
 So we’re going to leave you with a conversation I recently had with Dave about just that…,['Declarative Clause']
"Hundreds of thousands of interviews later, it’s hard to imagine how many moments like this exist in the archive.",['Declarative Clause']
"In 1931, a young Native Hawaiian man, Joseph Kahahawai, was wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting the wife of a U.S. Navy officer … ",['Declarative Clause']
"Soon after, he was killed by her relatives.",['Declarative Clause']
Kim Farrant is his niece.,['Declarative Clause']
"But growing up, her family never spoke about her uncle.",['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps in Honolulu, she told her sister …",['Declarative Clause']
Joy Kahahawai-Welch … how she first heard the story.\n ,['Declarative Clause']
I was in a Hawaiian history class in middle school and one of the topics was a very tragic story of a young man who was falsely accused of raping a woman and then the family kidnapped and murdered him.,['Declarative Clause']
And they were never brought to justice.,['Declarative Clause']
This man had the very same name as our dad: Joseph Kahahawai.,['Declarative Clause']
"The teacher then asked me, ‘Is this your family?’",['Declarative Clause']
"So I came home and I asked mom and she said, ‘Yeah. That is dad’s brother.’",['Declarative Clause']
He had just turned 23 years old right before he was killed. ,['Declarative Clause']
And then our dad was born just 11 months later. ,['Declarative Clause']
He inherited the very same name.,['Declarative Clause']
So Dad was the new Joe… and he became the star of our family.,['Declarative Clause']
He was like the sun that we all revolved around.,['Declarative Clause']
I think he knew that they wanted the name and the legacy to live on.,['Declarative Clause']
 You know… Dad innately carried himself a certain way to make his brother proud. ,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember wanting to hear more about what happened,['Declarative Clause']
" But the gist of it was, ‘It’s just too hard to talk about.’",['Declarative Clause']
" Right. I look back and I think, ‘Oh, is there something to be ashamed of?",['Declarative Clause']
But that first generation needed those years of silence and peace to heal and recover.,['Declarative Clause']
And it made us all hold each other more close and more dear …,['Declarative Clause']
 Like we’re this unbroken chain of family. ,['Declarative Clause']
" We pay our uncle our respects by going to the cemetery, you know? ",['Declarative Clause']
Taking care of it. ,['Declarative Clause']
It’s a humble cemetery in the middle of Kalihi.,['Declarative Clause']
And the plumeria tree above his grave has a lot of flowers.,['Declarative Clause']
 So fresh flowers are raining down on him daily right now. ,['Declarative Clause']
 ‘Ho’omana’o’ is on his gravestone and that’s a good reminder to never forget,['Declarative Clause']
Always remember.,['Declarative Clause']
"Corey Harvard has dedicated his life to helping LGBTQ youth in Mobile, Alabama. ",['Declarative Clause']
He grew up in a deeply religious family… and as a queer kid in the 90’s … he struggled to come out to his parents. ,['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps, he and his mom, Lisa Harvard looked back at that time…",['Declarative Clause']
"We had no idea, we really didn’t, so we were caught off guard, as you might say. ",['Declarative Clause']
"But, Mom, the amount of stuff I was looking at online when I got the computer, that was just me trying to learn about what it meant to be gay",['Declarative Clause']
"if y’all were Snoopy parents, it would have taken no time to figure it out.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember in that very first conversation, I was looking directly across from you, and you fell into your dad’s arms.",['Declarative Clause']
"I know that I was numb in a lot of ways because a big part of it was feeling separated from you, and I didn’t like that. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I remember feeling that distance.",['Declarative Clause']
" I think that with where all of us were, it was inevitable",['Declarative Clause']
"And during those months and a couple years there, you would come back, we would have more conversations. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Of course a lot of it we may not have understood, but it didn’t leave us just reeling, we talked about those things.",['Declarative Clause']
As we were figuring out what this was going to look like for us. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Sometimes I just go into your room, even though we’ve remodeled, we made sure not to touch that room, and I sit on your bed, and I am really so hopeful that it was a good space because I wanted you to be a happy kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"The truth is, I felt so loved as a kid, but, I mean, there’s a part of that journey that no one can join you on.",['Declarative Clause']
"A hard thing that I’ve always wanted to share with you, the beginning of my sophomore year, I was struggling the most.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it was this dark night of the soul where it’s like, can I really accept this?",['Interrogative Clause']
Have I failed at life? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"And there was that one night that got really hard, and I remember sitting on the windowsill and just contemplating it, like, what would it be like for this to all be over?",['Interrogative Clause']
"And this feeling that I had is you, and it’s like this invisible golden lasso.",['Declarative Clause']
" And I knew that even in this worst moment of my life, that I can’t fall.",['Declarative Clause']
And the work that I do with these kids is how I took that golden lasso and I turned it into a net.,['Declarative Clause']
And we just keep saving people with that love that you put in me.,['Declarative Clause']
 Sometimes I look at you and I just can’t fathom the kind of love that I see you give it’s a humbling experience. ,['Declarative Clause']
"That’s Corey Harvard and his mom Lisa Harvard in Mobile, Alabama.",['Declarative Clause']
"In 2018, Corey co-founded Prism United, which provides support groups and access to therapy for LGBTQ+ youth and their families in Southwest Alabama. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You came into my life and changed me in so many ways, I’m so much better now than I ever would have been without you…and I’m so grateful to be your mom.",['Declarative Clause']
"When Robert Robinson’s daughter, Angel, started rapidly losing weight… doctors incorrectly diagnosed them with an eating disorder.",['Declarative Clause']
But on one visit to the hospital… a doctor on-call discovered a rare stomach tumor.,['Declarative Clause']
"That doctor, John Fortunato, would stay with the family through Angel’s treatment up until their death in 2023.",['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps in Chicago, Dr. Fortunato sat down with Angel’s father for this conversation.",['Declarative Clause']
 My first memory of meeting Angel was in the hospital. ,['Declarative Clause']
"When I walked in the room, Angel was smiling the whole time.",['Declarative Clause']
A teenager who was… in control of the room. ,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember she told me to push her on her belly and I could make her throw up.,['Declarative Clause']
"After I diagnosed Angel with the tumor, what was your first response to that?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Before you discovered it, no one would listen to her.",['Declarative Clause']
Even me.,['Declarative Clause']
And… I still regret that.,['Declarative Clause']
 But I didn’t know. ,['Declarative Clause']
They were saying it was an eating disorder. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And, when you go to the doctor, you’re trusting the professionals.",['Declarative Clause']
"You just, ‘Okay, that’s what the doctor said, that’s what it is.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
"So I’m kind of trying to push her, you know what I mean?",['Interrogative Clause']
 And it’s not her fault. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Parents, myself included, don’t always see things clearly, especially as it relates to teenagers",['Declarative Clause']
But that doesn’t mean a parent’s doing something wrong.,['Declarative Clause']
 I never tell someone not to feel guilty because that’s not a fair expectation. ,['Declarative Clause']
"But, we just do the best we can to support and love our kids. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s something that amazed me… you being a single father of twins, and somehow spending an incredible amount of time and energy with both your daughters.",['Declarative Clause']
Nothing else mattered to me but my kids. ,['Declarative Clause']
We couldn’t rely on anybody but each other.,['Declarative Clause']
" It was us against the world type of situation that I feel made her stronger, mentally",['Declarative Clause']
"Cause it’s lot of times I wanted to be like… ‘Well, if you’re gonna die anyway, forget doing this chemo",['Declarative Clause']
 You can keep your hair,['Declarative Clause']
" And she would, ‘Nah, we don’t give up. I’m gonna keep fighting",['Declarative Clause']
Sometimes you sink or swim and I got the impression that Angel was not gonna sink under any circumstances.,['Declarative Clause']
"No, she wasn’t.",['Declarative Clause']
 I wasn’t ready to give up either.,['Declarative Clause']
"But I realized, you know, after a while… it was a, just, almost impossible situation.",['Declarative Clause']
"When Angel died, I just remember, standing over her trying to talk to her and her eyes was open but she wasn’t responsive. ",['Declarative Clause']
And her sister was singing to her,['Declarative Clause']
"And her heart rate was dropping, it was going from 180, it went down to 140.",['Declarative Clause']
From 140 it went down to 80.,['Declarative Clause']
From 80 it went down to 40 and… it was over.,['Declarative Clause']
"I wish that none of this had ever happened to your family but she, um, reminded me kinda what I got into this career to begin with for… and that’s the only regret is I wish I could have told her what her impact was.",['Declarative Clause']
" And I really appreciate those times, everyone was saying ‘It’s a wrap,’ you know what I mean?",['Declarative Clause']
"For you to still be there and be like, ‘Nah, there’s still stuff you can do, you ain’t gotta blow the trumpet just yet.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
"When a time when there wasn’t any hope, that really lifted us up.",['Declarative Clause']
Recording booths are places for people to look back on their lives… and sometimes… to look ahead… to a time when they’re no longer here…,['Declarative Clause']
That’s the direction that this conversation took…,['Declarative Clause']
"Conchetta Brown has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or C-O-P-D, and uses oxygen…",['Declarative Clause']
"She came to StoryCorps in San Antonio with her daughter, Nidera. ",['Declarative Clause']
"If this was to be your very last conversation, is there anything you want to say to me? ",['Interrogative Clause']
" I love you and I’m sorry I have to die but I have to go, girl",['Declarative Clause']
" It was good while it lasted, but I must go. ",['Declarative Clause']
You act like it’s the ending of a relationship ,['Declarative Clause']
It is! ,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, yeah, I guess it is… but–",['Declarative Clause']
Because no more mother and daughter.,['Declarative Clause']
" It’s just daughter, mother gone.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. But you won’t have to worry about oxygen,['Declarative Clause']
 I know that’s the truth,['Declarative Clause']
 No more medicine,['Declarative Clause']
"Oh, to think",['Declarative Clause']
No. You just have to slow down,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I try to do that",['Declarative Clause']
And then I forget what I’m doing.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, don’t slow down that much",['Imperative Clause']
"Oh… Well, what about you?",['Interrogative Clause']
What would you do?,['Interrogative Clause']
If this was my last conversation?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I would tell you the same thing, that I love you",['Declarative Clause']
Do you want to be cremated?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
Oh yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
And where you want us to throw you?,['Interrogative Clause']
"In the toilet, the garbage can?",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, not the garbage can",['Declarative Clause']
"All that, it didn’t make no sense to get me cremated",['Declarative Clause']
"Okay, so sorry",['Declarative Clause']
 Just get me cremated and throw me out back?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah,['Declarative Clause']
"We could use some soil and, you know, plant a tree",['Declarative Clause']
Oh yeah… That would be awesome. ,['Declarative Clause']
Uuuhuu.,['Declarative Clause']
"Something that can give fruit, you know",['Declarative Clause']
That can give back,['Declarative Clause']
"Yes, give it back",['Declarative Clause']
"So for your great great grandchild listening to this years from now, is there any wisdom you want to pass on to them?",['Interrogative Clause']
"You know, you don’t have to be religious to believe in something, ‘cause religion is what you do every day.",['Declarative Clause']
"And they got a song that say, ‘You don’t miss your water ‘til your well run dry.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
That’s why you’re supposed to treat people kind while they’re alive.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when your well dry, you want to see that person again",['Declarative Clause']
 But it’s all over,['Declarative Clause']
Yup,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, we made do girl…",['Declarative Clause']
" Eventually, I’ve gotta go.",['Declarative Clause']
And I know it’s gonna break your heart.,['Declarative Clause']
 I’ll be sad that I’m gone ‘cause I won’t have you to talk to,['Declarative Clause']
But it’s gonna be alright.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’mma always be with you, here.",['Declarative Clause']
Tchin <<chin>> is an artist and metalsmith,['Declarative Clause']
 He’s created designs for brands like Cartier <<CAR-tee-yay>>,['Declarative Clause']
He belongs to the Narragansett tribe,['Declarative Clause']
"Growing up, he moved between foster homes in Rhode Island and Virginia.",['Declarative Clause']
"And as he told his daughter Xiao Hui Star <<shah-way-star>>, he was often one of the few Indigenous people in town.",['Declarative Clause']
I looked different than everybody else. ,['Declarative Clause']
"There was either white people or Black people, and there was me.",['Declarative Clause']
"And so, I stood out",['Declarative Clause']
" And the cops would stop me sometimes, even as a young kid, they would stop me and go, ‘You know, you don’t belong in this neighborhood.’",['Declarative Clause']
"I was living in Rhode Island and Rhode Island School of Design had a, like, summer scholarships",['Declarative Clause']
" So I entered the competition and the art teacher said, ‘They don’t want people like you.’ And uh, I stopped drawing ever since then. ",['Declarative Clause']
Wow. ,['Exclamatory Clause']
"Yeah. It, it, it hurt. ",['Declarative Clause']
 How old were you?,['Interrogative Clause']
I might’ve been 13,['Declarative Clause']
Hmm. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, people would say, like, ‘You know, you’re gonna end up in jail,’ or, ‘You’re not gonna ever become anything’ or anything like that. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I was, ‘I’m gonna prove them wrong.",['Declarative Clause']
I need to go somewhere,['Declarative Clause']
I need more than this,['Declarative Clause']
And I went to New York,['Declarative Clause']
". And I slept in hallways, and I slept in the subways, and I slept in Grand Central Station.",['Declarative Clause']
"I really couldn’t read and write very well, and, uh, when I did have jobs, I usually weren’t able to keep those jobs",['Declarative Clause']
And then I learned to read and write by forcing myself to read an encyclopedia.,['Declarative Clause']
And I applied to go to an art school.,['Declarative Clause']
"I would like to hear more about how you built the confidence to pursue an artistic career, which I see as quite risky. ",['Interrogative Clause']
"It was a little scary, but because Mommy did so much supporting us, it wasn’t as scary as if I was the only breadwinner",['Declarative Clause']
 And my joke was always that I did all the cooking and the sewing.,['Declarative Clause']
And Mommy did the brickwork and the plumbing,['Declarative Clause']
"And when you girls were growing up, I made it a point that we would always have family meals on the weekend",['Declarative Clause']
"And I wanted to raise my girls as really strong, powerful women.",['Declarative Clause']
"I would always say, ‘What can I do? As a parent, to make your life better?’",['Declarative Clause']
" You girls would say, ‘I didn’t like when you raised your voice.",['Declarative Clause']
And then I would learn to not be so tough on you,['Declarative Clause']
" But you’re navigating the world very well, all of you",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m 38, the age that you were when you had me",['Declarative Clause']
What advice do you have for me?,['Interrogative Clause']
The sad thing about human beings is that we tend to remember the unhappy things. ,['Declarative Clause']
And I think my advice to you is just try to be happy,['Exclamatory Clause']
The longest life is short.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"Miranda Duschack and Mimo Davis’ have been farming together since 2012, supplying flowers in the St. Louis area.",['Declarative Clause']
At StoryCorps Miranda and Mimo told their own love story as the first lesbian couple married in Missouri,['Declarative Clause']
We met at work.,['Declarative Clause']
Right,['Declarative Clause']
At our day job.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then we decided to farm together…fell in love, got married, at a spiritual ceremony where we jumped the broom because we couldn’t legally be married. ",['Declarative Clause']
And then the second wedding was in 2014 to be legally married.,['Declarative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember this?,['Interrogative Clause']
When we had August.,['Declarative Clause']
"Do you remember how I pushed August out, ok…",['Interrogative Clause']
" What do you mean, do I remember that?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. But they didn’t know how to fill out the birth certificate.,['Declarative Clause']
 I do remember that,['Declarative Clause']
"So, I was making a fact sheet to leave at the nurse’s station about how to register. Um…",['Declarative Clause']
It’s okay.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s okay,['Declarative Clause']
You can have you some tears,['Declarative Clause']
"I just felt like we were total freaks, man.",['Declarative Clause']
"We weren’t freaks, we were just firsts",['Declarative Clause']
We were just first. ,['Declarative Clause']
And it was really embarrassing for me that we fought so hard to get married and then we got divorced,['Declarative Clause']
"But, you know, that was part of the rights that we fought for.",['Declarative Clause']
I know,['Declarative Clause']
" I mean, I would say that to people, You know, it…",['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s all part of the package, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
 You get to be married and then you get to be divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
 I mean,['Declarative Clause']
Right,['Declarative Clause']
"I was like, just like straight people.",['Declarative Clause']
Just like straight people,['Declarative Clause']
I can get divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
 I can get divorced,['Declarative Clause']
It didn’t necessarily pan out the way we thought it would be…,['Declarative Clause']
But we’re still in it,['Declarative Clause']
We’re still farming partners,['Declarative Clause']
We’re raising a beautiful son,['Declarative Clause']
 These are gorgeous flowers sitting in front of us,['Declarative Clause']
"And Mimo Davis, I’m going to say right now, I still really love you and care about you.",['Declarative Clause']
"Of course, of course, I love you and care about you too",['Declarative Clause']
I mean that was never in question for me,['Declarative Clause']
"We are both really, in our hearts and souls and deep down, totally committed to each other, and that’s why we work through all the real stuff",['Declarative Clause']
And I see that as a win.,['Declarative Clause']
The StoryCorps’ Military Voices Initiative records and shares the stories of service members and their families.,['Declarative Clause']
"In 1942, in the midst of World War 2, the Marine Corps officially opened its ranks to Black men",['Declarative Clause']
"More than 19,000 Black recruits signed up …  and became known as the Montford Point Marines … Named for the North Carolina base where they trained",['Declarative Clause']
"Most of these men have passed away, but through the StoryCorps Archive … we can still hear their stories …",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember the first time you put on the uniform? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"I just felt like, oh, I’m a proud Marine, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
I thought I was something. ,['Declarative Clause']
" I wanted to help fight for our country, and also show that we had the courage and intelligence to do so. ",['Declarative Clause']
We knew we were the best,['Declarative Clause']
Well we made it our business to be the best of the best.,['Declarative Clause']
 Not mediocre but the best,['Declarative Clause']
We’re going to hear now from Corporal Sidney Allen Francis.,['Declarative Clause']
"After serving as one of the first Black Marines… he worked as a New York City police detective… and in 2005 spoke with his daughter, Candice, at StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
" I wanted to go into the Army, but they said no.",['Declarative Clause']
And this was World War II? ,['Interrogative Clause']
": Yeah. And they stamped my papers ‘Navy,’ and there was no way in the Hell I was going to the Navy.",['Declarative Clause']
Why didn’t you want to go in the Navy?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I didn’t like the little hats they were in, the little ",['Declarative Clause']
"So then I said, ‘What about the Marine Corps?",['Interrogative Clause']
"The guy says, ‘Well, you have to go ‘round and see the Sergeant Major.’",['Declarative Clause']
First thing he said to me: ‘Are you a high school graduate?’,['Declarative Clause']
" I said, ‘Yes, sir.’",['Declarative Clause']
And I went to North Carolina for boot camp.,['Declarative Clause']
And what was that like? ,['Interrogative Clause']
" I mean, they were rough. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Now, were your drill instructors, were they white or Black? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, they were Black",['Declarative Clause']
". But see, they had trained under white instructors because up to 1942, the Marine Corps had no Blacks",['Declarative Clause']
 And that’s why they were extra tough on us.,['Declarative Clause']
They wanted us to make it,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, we did.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, I have to tell you, I once went to jail down there",['Declarative Clause']
" I was with my buddy from New York, he was in the Marine Corps, and we were going to Raleigh from Montford Point",['Declarative Clause']
And we’re sitting in the back of the bus,['Declarative Clause']
"Then the bus stopped to pick up people, and the bus driver came up and he said, uh, ‘You guys will have to get up",['Declarative Clause']
"I said, ‘Get up for what?",['Declarative Clause']
"He says, ‘These white people have to sit down.",['Declarative Clause']
" I said, ‘We’re in the back of the bus",['Declarative Clause']
"He said, ‘You ought to get up",['Declarative Clause']
 And I lost my head then,['Declarative Clause']
"I says, ‘We’re not getting up.",['Declarative Clause']
"And lo and behold, in not even 10 minutes, in comes police with guns drawn",['Declarative Clause']
 And they took me that night to some little prison camp.,['Declarative Clause']
" And in the morning I heard, ‘Warden, this is Major Pauper, United States Marine Corps.",['Declarative Clause']
 You got one of my boys in there.’,['Declarative Clause']
"All the Marines from Montford Point, they were on six by six trucks with machine guns at the ready.",['Declarative Clause']
You could see they just wanted to tear that jail down.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when I came out, Major Pauper, he says, ‘PFC Francis, you get on that truck. ",['Declarative Clause']
We’re out of here.,['Declarative Clause']
"And he hollered it back, ‘Thank you, Warden, that you didn’t hurt one of my Marines.",['Declarative Clause']
"He said, ‘You would have been in trouble.’",['Declarative Clause']
"That was Sidney Allen Francis speaking with his daughter, Candice.",['Declarative Clause']
"Sidney died February 15, 2014",['Declarative Clause']
 His daughter recently came back to StoryCorps\nCandice: So I didn’t know that story before,['Declarative Clause']
"He had never shared that with me, but it sounded like my father",['Declarative Clause']
I wasn’t surprised by that at all.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, a lot of Black men who served this country had to also suffer indignities, even while in uniform.",['Declarative Clause']
 I don’t think that they’ve gotten the credit that they deserve for putting their lives in danger.,['Declarative Clause']
"And coming out of it with scars that didn’t come from the so-called enemy, but came from within",['Declarative Clause']
 But what I appreciate about my father is that he used his military service to give him what he needed to build a life for himself and his family.,['Declarative Clause']
" It gave him purpose, and it gave him an anchor … And I’m grateful for that.",['Declarative Clause']
So what do you want your grandchildren to know about you? ,['Interrogative Clause']
" I want them to just remember that I loved them, that’s all.",['Declarative Clause']
There’s nothing exciting about me.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m just a man. ,['Declarative Clause']
Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…,['Declarative Clause']
"When I was seventeen, I got pregnant. ",['Declarative Clause']
And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.,['Declarative Clause']
 Wow. I just wasn’t ready for that.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m sure.,['Declarative Clause']
 I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s something I can’t make better for you,['Declarative Clause']
 And I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but… you’ll be okay…,['Declarative Clause']
They came back in 2023.,['Declarative Clause']
"At 88, Jackie’s health was declining…",['Declarative Clause']
Realizing his mom was nearing the end of life…,['Declarative Clause']
Scott wanted to do one more interview…,['Declarative Clause']
I cannot believe 15 years have passed,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t have any more revelations to unleash on you,['Declarative Clause']
 And now I have an old person’s voice.,['Declarative Clause']
 It cracks…,['Declarative Clause']
But I still don’t think of myself as old,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back. ",['Declarative Clause']
But that doesn’t keep me from doing it,['Declarative Clause']
" The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot. ",['Declarative Clause']
"He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous",['Declarative Clause']
But my world is really getting smaller. ,['Declarative Clause']
Words don’t come that easily to me now.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s really scary,['Declarative Clause']
" The other day, I couldn’t remember my cell phone number",['Declarative Clause']
" I recognize this is part of getting not older but old, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah… You know in our first interview I had said, uh… it scares me imagining life without you, and it doesn’t so much scare me anymore",['Declarative Clause']
" But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.",['Declarative Clause']
So when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone…,['Declarative Clause']
"It feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice. ",['Declarative Clause']
"One of the things every parent wants to know is just, how happy are you with your life?",['Declarative Clause']
"I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.",['Declarative Clause']
 I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you…,['Declarative Clause']
 There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that,['Declarative Clause']
"You can have great friends or loved ones, but it’s not the same.",['Declarative Clause']
As you’ve heard… StoryCorps has always been about chasing big ideas,['Declarative Clause']
And one of those big ideas is that every single person in the country would one day be able to record an interview. ,['Declarative Clause']
"But during our first ten years, if someone wanted to record, they’d have to come to one of our booths in person",['Declarative Clause']
" In 2015, that all changed",['Declarative Clause']
"That year, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay went on stage to give a TED Talk",['Declarative Clause']
"Tonight, I’m going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person’s life, and in yours…",['Declarative Clause']
Dave had won the TED Prize…. ,['Declarative Clause']
And that night he was on stage to reveal a brand new idea. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Here is my wish: that you will help us take everything we’ve learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world, so that anyone can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history.",['Declarative Clause']
"Over the past couple of months, the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths, so that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Together we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity, and maybe in doing so, we’ll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less. ",['Declarative Clause']
Maybe these conversations will remind us what is really important. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infinitely. ",['Declarative Clause']
Thank you very much. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And just like that, one of the largest barriers to participating in StoryCorps was gone. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Grandpa, tell me about your parents…",['Imperative Clause']
What was your first impression when you came to America?,['Interrogative Clause']
Can you share one of the happiest memories in your lifetime?,['Declarative Clause']
Tell me what you were like as a child and how did you like to spend your time…,['Imperative Clause']
"My advice is don’t grow up, it’s a trap!",['Declarative Clause']
 In this episode… stories from beyond the recording booth…,['Declarative Clause']
  I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris,['Declarative Clause']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
"A few months after the app came out, there was a perfect opportunity to get people to use it…",['Declarative Clause']
Thanksgiving – a holiday known for putting family members in the same room.,['Declarative Clause']
So that year… we asked people to use the app when they went home for the holidays,['Declarative Clause']
 We called it the Great Thanksgiving Listen… and it’s actually become a once-a-year tradition.,['Declarative Clause']
"The hope was that we could get enough people to interview each other… that we’d document an entire generation in one day… like we said, big ideas. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Anyway, the interviews started coming in… from people’s kitchens, hotel rooms… and even one from inside a parked car at a strip mall in Iowa…",['Declarative Clause']
We asked that person who recorded that one  to walk us through that experience…,['Declarative Clause']
Hi my name is Kara Masteller and I interviewed my grandfather in my 1994 Buick,['Declarative Clause']
How did you know that grandma was the one?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Well, she was a good looker",['Declarative Clause']
 We fit together.,['Declarative Clause']
We were a good pair.,['Declarative Clause']
"My grandma, everyone referred to her as like a spicy meatball. ",['Declarative Clause']
"She swore a lot, but she looked so innocent that no one ever expected her to say the things that she said.",['Declarative Clause']
Were you nervous to propose to her?,['Interrogative Clause']
No,['Declarative Clause']
"We had something to say, we said it",['Declarative Clause']
Like you.,['Declarative Clause']
What are the keys to a happy marriage?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Well if something happens just say, ‘I’m sorry’ and get it over with",['Declarative Clause']
 There’s no reason to carry on,['Declarative Clause']
" I just say ‘I’m sorry. I love ya,’ and that was the whole story.",['Declarative Clause']
I was really surprised by my grandpa saying sorry,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve never heard him say sorry.,['Declarative Clause']
 How would you like to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
Remem—? Ha,['Declarative Clause']
Do you want to be remembered as like a real tough guy? Or…,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I was a pretty soft guy.",['Declarative Clause']
 You intimidated me when I was little.,['Declarative Clause']
I did?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. You did,['Declarative Clause']
 Are you happy about the life you’ve lived?,['Interrogative Clause']
Oh yeah. It wasn’t the easiest life back in them days.,['Interrogative Clause']
Mother died when I was four. ,['Interrogative Clause']
And it was a tough life.,['Interrogative Clause']
He tells one story about how he was eight or nine and he was ice skating on the river and he fell through,['Declarative Clause']
He didn’t have hot water wherever he was living with his dad,['Declarative Clause']
So he broke into the school and just took a hot shower in the school.,['Declarative Clause']
I think that says a lot about his childhood that there was really no one there to help him get out of the water or keep him warm.,['Declarative Clause']
"Last April he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and I had never really heard him say much about it.",['Declarative Clause']
 What do you think about Alzheimer’s?,['Interrogative Clause']
Not much you can do,['Declarative Clause']
I even can’t remember some names now myself.,['Declarative Clause']
So maybe I have got it,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t know.,['Declarative Clause']
" And when he said, ‘I don’t know what it would be like to have it",['Declarative Clause']
That was difficult for me,['Declarative Clause']
" So then I had to ask a follow-up just out of, I don’t know, self-preservation because I thought I was gonna cry.",['Declarative Clause']
"As people age, do you have any advice for them as they get older?",['Interrogative Clause']
It’s coming.,['Declarative Clause']
 Don’t fight it. ,['Declarative Clause']
Just roll with.,['Imperative Clause']
 I mean real life.,['Declarative Clause']
 Live it.,['Imperative Clause']
It’s wonderful.,['Declarative Clause']
Thank you grandpa.,['Declarative Clause']
After the interview my grandpa and I talked a lot more,['Declarative Clause']
"The last thing he said \n(laughs) before we got out of the car was, ‘Let’s give ‘em hell kiddo.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s Kara Masteller with her grandfather James Kennicott from her 1994 Buick in an Iowa parking lot…,['Declarative Clause']
"Before this… StoryCorps typically had been recording about 7,000 interviews a year.",['Declarative Clause']
"But with the app… on the Sunday after Thanksgiving… 17,000 interviews were added to the archive. ",['Declarative Clause']
The app made it possible for people to record even if their hometown wasn’t a stop on the StoryCorps tour… which is important… because some conversations can’t wait. Dave Isay knew that first hand… ,['Declarative Clause']
" Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad",['Declarative Clause']
"I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago, when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health, was diagnosed with cancer. ",['Declarative Clause']
He passed away very suddenly a few days later.,['Declarative Clause']
I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died.,['Declarative Clause']
" I have a couple of young kids at home, and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session",['Declarative Clause']
"I thought I couldn’t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did, but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.",['Declarative Clause']
"Every day, people come up to me and say, ”I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother, but I waited too long.” Now, no one has to wait anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
"And we saw people using the app in this way, like Eva Vega-Olds… ",['Declarative Clause']
"In 2015, her father Leonardo was diagnosed with lung cancer.",['Declarative Clause']
After going through chemo unsuccessfully… he went into hospice care at his home in New Jersey.,['Declarative Clause']
And Eva used the app to preserve his voice…,['Declarative Clause']
"When I was recording my dad, I was in his bedroom that he shared with my mom.",['Declarative Clause']
"There was the hospital bed in there, he had an oxygen machine, and he was struggling to breath, but I said, “Dad, do you want to do an interview?",['Declarative Clause']
" And he said, “Let her rip,” and so we did.",['Declarative Clause']
"Daddy, where were you born",['Interrogative Clause']
Puerto Rico.,['Declarative Clause']
 And do you know how long you’ve been in New Jersey?,['Interrogative Clause']
Sixty-five years,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve been here all my life.,['Declarative Clause']
" He was a factory worker, worked the graveyard shift, you know so he’s leaving for work when we’re coming back from school",['Declarative Clause']
" And then later on, he was a custodian and he was always working.",['Declarative Clause']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
 I don’t know…,['Declarative Clause']
"Well I plan on telling the kids that you were really loyal, a committed father… funny…",['Declarative Clause']
"My family’s the kind of family that if you can’t take sarcasm, forget about it. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Like my wedding day, I remember walking down the aisle, and my dad was walking like super slow. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I’m like, “Dad!”",['Declarative Clause']
" And he says to me, “Shhh, it’s my day. I finally get rid of you.”",['Declarative Clause']
 Do you remember teaching me how to swim?,['Interrogative Clause']
I remember you throwing me in the water and I was screaming and crying like I was gonna drown. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And I was like, “No, I can’t swim!” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And then you yelled at me, “Well then just stand up” (laughs.",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember that?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
"When we took him home, he came back to hospice care and the nurses were there",['Declarative Clause']
"He looked at me and he said, “I think they think I’m gonna die.",['Declarative Clause']
" And I said, “Well, if you feel differently then do differently.”",['Declarative Clause']
But every day he got weaker and closer to the end.,['Declarative Clause']
 Do you think you’re dying?,['Interrogative Clause']
 Everybody dies.,['Declarative Clause']
"Up until that moment, we had not talked about him dying.",['Declarative Clause']
: Are you afraid?,['Interrogative Clause']
No.,['Declarative Clause']
 wish it wasn’t happening right now. ,['Declarative Clause']
What are you most proud of Daddy?,['Interrogative Clause']
Your kids?,['Interrogative Clause']
My family.,['Declarative Clause']
"Okay, let me end it for now…",['Declarative Clause']
I did the interview Tuesday afternoon and he passed on Thursday night.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, not for nothing but my dad’s a working class fellow, he bought a home, paid off his home, and was able to die in his home, with his family around him.",['Declarative Clause']
"For him, that was the pinnacle of what your life should be",['Declarative Clause']
And I think that he did achieve his dreams.,['Declarative Clause']
Coming up after the break… ,['Declarative Clause']
"StoryCorps’ whole business model, if you will, is getting two people together in an enclosed space to talk right at each other, which, you know, when there’s a global respiratory pandemic is, you know, not great. ",['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Declarative Clause']
When the entire world came to a halt in March of 2020… so did StoryCorps,['Declarative Clause']
"We all were kind of like, what the heck do we do? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"That’s Martin Olson, the director of digital at StoryCorps – he’s the guy behind the scenes who keeps things like our app and the archive running",['Declarative Clause']
 And in the early days of Covid… when suddenly no one could sit down together for an interview anymore… he had to kind of figure out how to keep StoryCorps itself running,['Declarative Clause']
" I remember we were still at the StoryCorps offices and Dave just came by and, sort of, started chatting",['Declarative Clause']
" He was just like, “Can we do anything remote?",['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, obviously looking a little bit panicked",['Declarative Clause']
"Like, How can we actually do something that helps bring people together in this crazy moment?",['Declarative Clause']
" I had actually been messing around a little bit with remote recording, and, at that point, Zoom had entered people’s lives very quickly. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, here we come, a non-profit with a two person digital team and we’re like, “Cool, we’re going to build a thing.",['Declarative Clause']
"Trust us, it’ll work.”",['Declarative Clause']
And just like that…another “big idea” was born… ,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember over a weekend basically sat down and banged together like a little basic prototype.,['Declarative Clause']
Two people with browsers can see each other; they can talk to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
We can record this audio and then we can get that to talk to our archive. ,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, that weekend where you sat down to just be like, I gotta build this thing?",['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, are you hunched over your computer til three in the morning, like, how are you doing this? ",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I guess coffee is an occupational hazard of being both a computer nerd and Swedish–actually my son’s first word was kaffe, which is, uh, coffee in Swedish",['Declarative Clause']
" So thankfully that kept me going, but honestly it was a little bit sort of piece by piece, right?",['Declarative Clause']
" It’s like, alright well, Okay so I’ve got one window and I can see myself in that one and I can see myself in this one",['Declarative Clause']
Great. Check,['Declarative Clause']
" Okay, so they need to hit a record button",['Declarative Clause']
 Alright so we’ll add that,['Declarative Clause']
Did it work? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Crap it didn’t work,['Declarative Clause']
"Alright, doop, doop, doop…",['Declarative Clause']
Try a thing.,['Declarative Clause']
You realize that you forgot a semicolon somewhere because it’s two in the morning,['Declarative Clause']
" It’s a little bit of just sort of trying your way forward sometimes, until you sort of look up and you’re like oh, I should probably go to bed or I’m gonna be a little groggy tomorrow. ",['Declarative Clause']
"So was all of this exciting for you as, like, a nerdy tech guy? Or was it terrifying?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I resent the premise of the question as a nerdy tech guy, but…",['Declarative Clause']
"Hey, I’m using your words",['Declarative Clause']
 As a highly socially competent tech guy.,['Declarative Clause']
"I don’t remember a moment where I kinda walked in and it was like, you know, Shark Tank and I was like, “Dave, here’s my prototype.”",['Declarative Clause']
"hink it was more like, “look I put this thing together; it seems like this is a thing we can do.”",['Declarative Clause']
 Next thing I know it’s got a name called StoryCorps Connect,['Declarative Clause']
"They’re like, “When can we get this thing done?”  ",['Declarative Clause']
You’ve got 48 hours…,['Declarative Clause']
: Well no…yeah right.,['Declarative Clause']
 It was a lot faster than you’d really wanna do this kind of thing. ,['Declarative Clause']
But it was not like a single ‘just me’ effort. ,['Declarative Clause']
There was a lot of different people involved.,['Declarative Clause']
"At the time I also worked with another great guy named Steven on our technology team, so a lot of the early interviews are he and I testing internally.  ",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, so this is a recording from my phone",['Declarative Clause']
And I guess the real question is how is this going to come out on the other side,['Declarative Clause']
Will it come out at all?,['Declarative Clause']
Let’s see what happens.,['Declarative Clause']
We’ve gotta see if this thing records so I’ve gotta sit there and just record myself I guess,['Declarative Clause']
"And so there’s a lot of me just like doo doo doo doo doo, you know,  into the thing and like…",['Declarative Clause']
Doo doo doo,['Declarative Clause']
"Before we released it more widely, we actually have a whole raft of interviews that were staff members calling family members. ",['Declarative Clause']
And this includes you…,['Declarative Clause']
 Yeah. So I’ve got one with my sister.,['Declarative Clause']
"So hey, how’s it going?",['Interrogative Clause']
" It’s going alright, how are you?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Ah you know, stressing out.",['Declarative Clause']
"Because this thing tomorrow, in theory, this thing is going to go live and I basically built it in two weeks ",['Declarative Clause']
Are we testing it?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, we’re testing it.",['Declarative Clause']
After lots of testing and fixing StoryCorps Connect on the fly… we opened it up to the public…and… people started to use it.,['Declarative Clause']
When did you realize COVID-19 was serious?,['Interrogative Clause']
My anxiety levels are always on 10,['Declarative Clause']
"I pray on my way to work, I pray on my lunch break",['Declarative Clause']
 What keeps me going is the fact that I need to keep goin.,['Declarative Clause']
I fear whenever I leave the house,['Declarative Clause']
"Everyday I wake up and just wonder, ’Is this the day that COVID-19 is gonna come home with me?’",['Declarative Clause']
"I’ve lost several people over these last couple months that I wasn’t able to say goodbye to, and so that has been really hard",['Declarative Clause']
 One of the things I miss most is giving you a hug,['Declarative Clause']
"And uh, when this is all over it’s, uh, one of the things I wanna do. ",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember we had this feeling like, you know, this is this important moment, not only do we need to be here to, you know, help people connect, but also, you know, to document this moment when all of a sudden people found themselves in this new alien world, right? ",['Declarative Clause']
"This new world was scary, unknown, and lonely…because the only thing worse than not seeing loved ones… was the possibility of exposing them to the virus…",['Declarative Clause']
"Dr. Roberto Vargas was the Director of Microbiology at a hospital in Rochester, New York",['Declarative Clause']
When the pandemic hit he found himself working long hours in the lab… running countless COVID tests.,['Declarative Clause']
Because of the risk… and for the sake of his wife and four kids… he started living in a hotel near his lab… and then later in the basement of their house.,['Declarative Clause']
"That’s where he was for this StoryCorps Connect recording… with his wife, Susan, and their 10-year-old son, Xavier, directly upstairs from him… but speaking through their computers",['Declarative Clause']
"When I would go to the hotel room after a long day and it was just me there, and it was very quiet; that was when I missed you all the most.",['Declarative Clause']
"It got very worrying once I knew the virus was going to be, like, a big thing, and with you gone it was way harder. I just missed you.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember you’d dropped groceries off and put them on the front porch, and that’s when we started talking through the window next to our front door. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You would talk on your cell phone, and the kids and I would sit behind the window.",['Declarative Clause']
" And I remember one of the hardest nights, I think you were just exhausted, you just had your head on the window and were crying.",['Declarative Clause']
"But eventually, you started sleeping in the basement",['Declarative Clause']
And I would not let the kids go past the top of the basement stairs.,['Declarative Clause']
"We had to stay far away but I just felt better that you could be, like, a part of us. ",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s still very hard but it’s just nice to see you, Dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"You have been so helpful to mom, so thank you, ok?",['Interrogative Clause']
Thanks.,['Declarative Clause']
"I remember, once you came into the basement, the best night I had yet, you know, your coworker had made all these different dishes for us",['Declarative Clause']
"You sat at the bottom of the stairs in a rocking chair, and I was at the top.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember that, yes. I even remember the food; it smelled so good.",['Declarative Clause']
"It was the first time we had been able to connect in so long and, as crazy as it sounds, it’s the best date I’ve ever had with you in my life.",['Declarative Clause']
"Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to do what I’ve been able to do at work",['Declarative Clause']
You have to be absolutely everything to our four beautiful kids,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve never loved you more and I know it hasn’t been easy.,['Declarative Clause']
"Can you guys try not to cry, it makes me sad when you cry",['Imperative Clause']
"Oh sorry, honey",['Declarative Clause']
These are tears of happiness,['Declarative Clause']
"Roberto, I admire you so much–always admired you–but you’ve done things these \npast couple months that seem impossible",['Declarative Clause']
"What you’re doing is a lot harder than what I’m doing, a lot harder.",['Declarative Clause']
" Dad, I just want to say thank you for helping get rid of this virus",['Declarative Clause']
That’s a team effort and that team includes you.,['Declarative Clause']
 But what carries me through is this family.,['Declarative Clause']
" StoryCorps was always really about people talking to each other and looking back, sort of saying, like, where did you grow up?",['Declarative Clause']
How did you get to this place?,['Interrogative Clause']
" During that time though we actually have so much of people just connecting with each other and saying, like, so how has this been for you? ",['Declarative Clause']
How is this currently going? ,['Declarative Clause']
"These basic realities of, like, figuring out how to be around each other, how to find toilet paper, you know, which, remember that? ",['Declarative Clause']
God yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
 That was fun.,['Declarative Clause']
" At this point, it’s been more than half a year that we’ve been living in isolation… and then Thanksgiving comes along… a holiday where we’re all supposed to get together. ",['Declarative Clause']
"So once again, the question was… what do we do?",['Interrogative Clause']
"There was an older story from before the pandemic…about a vacuum repair guy from Melrose, Massachusetts named Scott MacCaulay… and he hosts Thanksgiving dinner for strangers. ",['Declarative Clause']
We thought maybe he’d have the answer…,['Declarative Clause']
Here’s his original story from 2010…,['Declarative Clause']
My folks decided to get divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
" And if you were nice to one, the other one would get mad with you",['Declarative Clause']
"When October came, I thought, gee, you know, what’s going to happen at Thanksgiving?",['Declarative Clause']
"So I just thought, well, there must be some other people that are in the same boat. ",['Declarative Clause']
Why should they have that rotten feeling?,['Interrogative Clause']
 Why should they be stuck home alone?,['Interrogative Clause']
" So, I put an ad in the local paper and offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner for twelve people",['Declarative Clause']
People came and they had a good time,['Declarative Clause']
"And, last year 84 people showed up",['Declarative Clause']
What I do is transform the hall at the First Baptist Church to look as close to home as I can get it,['Declarative Clause']
 I have a fake fireplace,['Declarative Clause']
 I have Norman Rockwell’s famous Thanksgiving picture framed,['Declarative Clause']
And the way I test my success or failure is how long they stay.,['Declarative Clause']
"Last year, I had a family show up two hours late",['Declarative Clause']
 He had lost his job and they had heard about the dinner and wanted something to eat,['Declarative Clause']
". And, some of these people might not have anything, but they always find something that they can be grateful for.",['Declarative Clause']
"My goal is always to have nobody sign up, ’cause that means everybody’s got a place to go and everybody’s okay",['Declarative Clause']
And that’s what keeps me going twenty-five years later.,['Declarative Clause']
So in 2020…we reached back out to Scott to see how he was dealing with this new reality.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, turns out…instead of hosting an in-person event… Scott partnered with a local restaurant to give away free meals from the window of his vacuum repair shop.",['Declarative Clause']
"Using StoryCorps Connect, Scott spoke with his friend Loretta Saint-Louis, who he met during one of his dinners.",['Declarative Clause']
I was new to Melrose and I didn’t really know people here,['Declarative Clause']
. And I saw the advertisement.,['Declarative Clause']
I think it was in the paper,['Declarative Clause']
 And it took a bit of courage for me to just call you.,['Declarative Clause']
What was your first impression of this crazy guy on the other end of the phone?,['Interrogative Clause']
You were so friendly,['Declarative Clause']
" I was blown away, all the care that you put into it",['Declarative Clause']
It felt like I was going to a family Thanksgiving event.,['Declarative Clause']
 And I’m going to miss that a lot.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, because of the COVID-19 crisis",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve offered people alternatives to us getting together. ,['Declarative Clause']
"It’s nice to know that you still want to feed us, but it’s the togetherness of it that’s important.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, all the people that come …they are young and old, male, female from different places, backgrounds, and countries",['Declarative Clause']
"And what I find always interesting is despite the great differences, they all have similar things that they’re thankful for.",['Declarative Clause']
And some of them will make you cry.,['Declarative Clause']
 Somebody will say their son’s now speaking to them. ,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, no matter what your condition is, health-wise, financial, or newly divorced, or newly widowed, they focus for some time on good things",['Declarative Clause']
And I think that’s \nwonderful.,['Declarative Clause']
What advice do you have for people who will be alone this year?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I would say call everybody and anybody that you can think of tell them, “I love you.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Don’t talk with your mouth full, you know, we don’t want spraying turkey all over the computer screen or the phone.",['Declarative Clause']
But connect with as many people that you think might be alone or would appreciate a call and tell them you’re thinking of them.,['Declarative Clause']
"My philosophy is: I can’t fix the country or the world or even the town, but I can brighten my own corner",['Declarative Clause']
" It doesn’t matter what any of the differences that we can divide ourselves with, if your neighbor’s house is burning down, you run to put the fire out",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m not going to sit around, talk about it",['Declarative Clause']
 I’m just going to do something about it,['Declarative Clause']
And that’s sort of what the Thanksgiving dinner is all about,['Declarative Clause']
"That would be my hope for America, that everybody would just brighten the corner where they are.",['Declarative Clause']
"We checked in with Scott again this year, and he’s still running those takeaway dinners",['Declarative Clause']
"Last year, he served 100 people.",['Declarative Clause']
 It was just a weird weird time.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, and… It is so bananas to think back to it now.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I really do think that it generally felt, just, good to do something",['Declarative Clause']
And I’m the first person to say that technology is not the solution to a lot of problems.,['Declarative Clause']
"ut it is nice when there is something where, like, you can think of a way to do something that just wouldn’t be possible otherwise",['Declarative Clause']
"And, again, hopefully, if you’ve done your job right, the technology somewhat melts away, and it’s just communication.",['Declarative Clause']
It’s just people. ,['Declarative Clause']
 And it continues today. ,['Declarative Clause']
"eah. It’s still what we use to record, you know, a lot of interviews",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s really opened us up to connect people who have something to say to each other but they’re not in the same place. ,['Declarative Clause']
"I always used to joke with people that whenever there’s a zombie apocalypse, right, I’m not going to be much use because a lot of my skills have to do with plugging things together and, like, electronics and computers. ",['Declarative Clause']
"But in this case, all these computer nerdy skills actually came in handy when it had to actually wire things together. ",['Declarative Clause']
"So you know, that was nice. ",['Declarative Clause']

Thanks for listening.,['Declarative Clause']
Time now for StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
"In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV. ",['Declarative Clause']
And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know what the biggest joy was? Finding a smile in that small, sick child",['Interrogative Clause']
That just made my week.,['Declarative Clause']
 During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Declarative Clause']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work.",['Declarative Clause']
Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Declarative Clause']
"We missed every single dinner date, every movie.",['Declarative Clause']
And that led into a thirty year relationship.,['Declarative Clause']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Declarative Clause']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses. ",['Declarative Clause']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother. ",['Declarative Clause']
And we’d leave bouquets of roses at their door.,['Declarative Clause']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Declarative Clause']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Declarative Clause']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Declarative Clause']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s not the glitz. It’s the simple touches.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence.",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV. You see everything as an opportunity because you’re here.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you really believe and you live – if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.",['Declarative Clause']
I can guarantee it.,['Declarative Clause']
I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started,['Declarative Clause']
 And they would see me again around Christmas time,['Declarative Clause']
And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again.,['Declarative Clause']
"So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable.",['Declarative Clause']
And as far as you doing the business? ,['Interrogative Clause']
You started younger than me,['Declarative Clause']
As soon as I could walk.,['Declarative Clause']
 Even before you were walking.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I…",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.,['Declarative Clause']
I was literally there since day one.,['Declarative Clause']
"I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.” ",['Declarative Clause']
"Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. ",['Declarative Clause']
"One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.",['Declarative Clause']
I have a sense of usefulness.,['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.",['Declarative Clause']
" I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…",['Declarative Clause']
That comes from coming from immigrant parents,['Declarative Clause']
You can never work hard enough. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Interrogative Clause']
Never,['Declarative Clause']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, never.",['Declarative Clause']
nd when am I gonna retire?,['Interrogative Clause']
 One day before your funeral?,['Interrogative Clause']
PM: You know it.,['Declarative Clause']
 Yup. [Laughter],['Declarative Clause']
"You know if you ever didn’t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken.",['Declarative Clause']
I would understand.,['Declarative Clause']
" Yeah, yeah.",['Declarative Clause']
: You know what I mean?,['Interrogative Clause']
" My father, he hated my business man.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time. ",['Declarative Clause']
"But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.” ",['Declarative Clause']
I like that.,['Declarative Clause']
" You raised all of us, man.",['Declarative Clause']
"Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man. ",['Declarative Clause']
That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.,['Declarative Clause']
Well you do your best kid.,['Declarative Clause']
 This is what you do. ,['Declarative Clause']
But honestly your best.,['Declarative Clause']
Not just your B.S. best.,['Declarative Clause']
And even if you fail. It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re always my barometer. You never let anyone down. That’s what sets you apart.,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Rob Rigano.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Interrogative Clause']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately. Yes [laughs]",['Declarative Clause']
 Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego,['Declarative Clause']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Declarative Clause']
He came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.,['Declarative Clause']
"My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.",['Declarative Clause']
"What’s your earliest memory, Rob? ",['Interrogative Clause']
 I rolled my Uncle Charlie’s Dodge into the street light. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Wait, what happened?-",['Interrogative Clause']
" Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Declarative Clause']
 Into a telephone pole? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes. [laughs],['Declarative Clause']
"Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled. He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.  ",['Declarative Clause']
"Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I fell out. ",['Declarative Clause']
" Yeah? And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving? ",['Declarative Clause']
" No, the locks were defected. ",['Declarative Clause']
So you weren’t playing with the door handle? ,['Interrogative Clause']
No. ,['Declarative Clause']
I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.,['Declarative Clause']
: I know you had trouble with the locks  [laughs],['Declarative Clause']
And then another time I bit a horse.,['Declarative Clause']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Declarative Clause']
 I thought I did?,['Interrogative Clause']
"The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.”",['Declarative Clause']
 Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years.,['Declarative Clause']
"Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping. ",['Declarative Clause']
And he got to know nearly every resident,['Declarative Clause']
He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people. ,['Declarative Clause']
In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?”",['Interrogative Clause']
He just has that sense of what’s right. ,['Declarative Clause']
What’s your happiest memory? ,['Interrogative Clause']
" Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim.",['Declarative Clause']
 But my dad’s a little excitable. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Why do you think that is, Rob?",['Interrogative Clause']
I think that’s his nature,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah? Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"No no, that’s his nature. ",['Declarative Clause']
Rolling cars into trees?,['Interrogative Clause']
 I don’t do that anymore.,['Declarative Clause']
Oh okay,['Declarative Clause']
"I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?” ",['Interrogative Clause']
"Because he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor. He is not as effervescent as he used to be. ",['Declarative Clause']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together. ,['Declarative Clause']
He is a gem of a guy and we all helped polish him.,['Declarative Clause']
Anything else Rob?,['Interrogative Clause']
 I think that’s about it. ,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. ,['Declarative Clause']
And next year we could have stories about you.,['Declarative Clause']
the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay… \nAnd if you called in the 1980s… longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone.,['Declarative Clause']
At StoryCorps… she remembered what this work meant to her.,['Declarative Clause']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building. ,['Declarative Clause']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. ",['Declarative Clause']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth",['Declarative Clause']
" It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy. ",['Declarative Clause']
But it was our place.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, it was beautiful.",['Declarative Clause']
"Typical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically? ",['Declarative Clause']
"But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk… Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something.",['Declarative Clause']
Should I tell my parents? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’ ,['Interrogative Clause']
"The suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that.",['Declarative Clause']
 I had a few of those calls.,['Declarative Clause']
" ‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’ That’s all we could say, really",['Declarative Clause']
"But I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.",['Declarative Clause']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Declarative Clause']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him. ",['Declarative Clause']
And my mother?,['Interrogative Clause']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Declarative Clause']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters.,['Declarative Clause']
"So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, and I was still like just a kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted. ",['Declarative Clause']
But that wasn’t who I was. ,['Declarative Clause']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s what people wanted to hear. ,['Declarative Clause']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Declarative Clause']
" You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone. ",['Declarative Clause']
"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And you bent over and kissed me on the head. It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.’",['Declarative Clause']
And I felt that things really would be OK.,['Declarative Clause']
"When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died. ",['Declarative Clause']
And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person.,['Declarative Clause']
" Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’",['Declarative Clause']
And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill,['Declarative Clause']
"And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.",['Declarative Clause']
": Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter. ",['Declarative Clause']
I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.",['Declarative Clause']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019,['Declarative Clause']
"After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.",['Declarative Clause']
My relationship with you is very important to me.,['Declarative Clause']
"Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved.",['Declarative Clause']
"And when I met you, it made me feel so much better",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Interrogative Clause']
": To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another… And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.",['Declarative Clause']
 It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had. It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.,['Declarative Clause']
" We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends.",['Declarative Clause']
And we had that book at her funeral service.,['Declarative Clause']
" So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief… Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us.",['Declarative Clause']
And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind,['Declarative Clause']
" I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.",['Declarative Clause']
And that was in a big way John.,['Declarative Clause']
 I almost feel like you’re a brother.\n ,['Declarative Clause']
 I suspect our mothers have something to do with that. ,['Declarative Clause']
They might quite well.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think.",['Declarative Clause']
So what a gift they gave us.,['Declarative Clause']
They certainly did.,['Declarative Clause']
Close,['Declarative Clause']
"In 1931, a young Native Hawaiian man, Joseph Kahahawai, was wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting the wife of a U.S. Navy officer …  Soon after, he was killed by her relatives",['Declarative Clause']
Kim Farrant is his niece.,['Declarative Clause']
"But growing up, her family never spoke about her uncle.",['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps in Honolulu, she told her sister …  Joy Kahahawai-Welch … how she first heard the story.",['Declarative Clause']
I was in a Hawaiian history class in middle school and one of the topics was a very tragic story of a young man who was falsely accused of raping a woman and then the family kidnapped and murdered him,['Declarative Clause']
And they were never brought to justice.,['Declarative Clause']
This man had the very same name as our dad: Joseph Kahahawai.,['Declarative Clause']
"The teacher then asked me, ‘Is this your family?’",['Interrogative Clause']
"So I came home and I asked mom and she said, ‘Yeah. That is dad’s brother.’",['Declarative Clause']
He had just turned 23 years old right before he was killed. ,['Declarative Clause']
nd then our dad was born just 11 months later.,['Declarative Clause']
He inherited the very same name. ,['Declarative Clause']
So Dad was the new Joe… and he became the star of our family. ,['Declarative Clause']
He was like the sun that we all revolved around.,['Declarative Clause']
I think he knew that they wanted the name and the legacy to live on.,['Declarative Clause']
 You know… Dad innately carried himself a certain way to make his brother proud. ,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember wanting to hear more about what happened. ,['Declarative Clause']
"But the gist of it was, ‘It’s just too hard to talk about.’",['Declarative Clause']
" Right. I look back and I think, ‘Oh, is there something to be ashamed of?’",['Interrogative Clause']
But that first generation needed those years of silence and peace to heal and recover.,['Declarative Clause']
And it made us all hold each other more close and more dear … Like we’re this unbroken chain of family. ,['Declarative Clause']
"We pay our uncle our respects by going to the cemetery, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
Taking care of it. ,['Declarative Clause']
It’s a humble cemetery in the middle of Kalihi. ,['Declarative Clause']
And the plumeria tree above his grave has a lot of flowers. ,['Declarative Clause']
So fresh flowers are raining down on him daily right now.,['Declarative Clause']
Ho’omana’o’ is on his gravestone and that’s a good reminder to never forget. ,['Declarative Clause']
Always remember.,['Imperative Clause']
Recording booths are places for people to look back on their lives… and sometimes… to look ahead… to a time when they’re no longer here…,['Declarative Clause']
That’s the direction that this conversation took…,['Declarative Clause']
"Conchetta Brown has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or C-O-P-D, and uses oxygen…",['Declarative Clause']
"She came to StoryCorps in San Antonio with her daughter, Nidera. ",['Declarative Clause']
"  If this was to be your very last conversation, is there anything you want to say to me? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"I love you and I’m sorry I have to die but I have to go, girl.",['Declarative Clause']
"It was good while it lasted, but I must go. ",['Declarative Clause']
 You act like it’s the ending of a relationship [Laughs].  ,['Declarative Clause']
It is!,['Exclamatory Clause']
"Well, yeah, I guess it is… but–",['Declarative Clause']
Because no more mother and daughter.,['Declarative Clause']
"It’s just daughter, mother gone.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. ,['Declarative Clause']
But you won’t have to worry about oxygen. ,['Declarative Clause']
I know that’s the truth,['Declarative Clause']
No more medicine.,['Declarative Clause']
"Oh, to think–",['Declarative Clause']
No,['Declarative Clause']
You just have to slow down. ,['Imperative Clause']
"Yeah, I try to do that.",['Declarative Clause']
And then I forget what I’m doing. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, don’t slow down that much. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Oh… Well, what about you? ",['Interrogative Clause']
What would you do?  ,['Interrogative Clause']
If this was my last conversation?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I would tell you the same thing, that I love you. ",['Declarative Clause']
Do you want to be cremated?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
Oh yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
And where you want us to throw you? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"In the toilet, the garbage can? ",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, not the garbage can. All that, it didn’t make no sense to get me cremated",['Declarative Clause']
"Okay, so sorry. ",['Declarative Clause']
Just get me cremated and throw me out back?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah [Laughs]. ,['Declarative Clause']
"We could use some soil and, you know, plant a tree.",['Declarative Clause']
Oh yeah… That would be awesome. ,['Declarative Clause']
Uuuhuu,['Declarative Clause']
"Something that can give fruit, you know. ",['Declarative Clause']
 That can give back. ,['Declarative Clause']
" Yes, give it back.",['Declarative Clause']
"So for your great great grandchild listening to this years from now, is there any wisdom you want to pass on to them?",['Interrogative Clause']
"You know, you don’t have to be religious to believe in something, ‘cause religion is what you do every day. And they got a song that say, ‘You don’t miss your water ‘til your well run dry.’",['Declarative Clause']
That’s why you’re supposed to treat people kind while they’re alive.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
" And when your well dry, you want to see that person again.",['Declarative Clause']
But it’s all over. ,['Declarative Clause']
Yup,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, we made do girl… Eventually, I’ve gotta go. ",['Declarative Clause']
And I know it’s gonna break your heart.,['Declarative Clause']
 I’ll be sad that I’m gone ‘cause I won’t have you to talk to. ,['Declarative Clause']
But it’s gonna be alright.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’mma always be with you, here.",['Declarative Clause']
 I looked different than everybody else.,['Declarative Clause']
"There was either white people or Black people, and there was me.",['Declarative Clause']
"And so, I stood out. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And the cops would stop me sometimes, even as a young kid, they would stop me and go, ‘You know, you don’t belong in this neighborhood.’",['Declarative Clause']
"I was living in Rhode Island and Rhode Island School of Design had a, like, summer scholarships.",['Declarative Clause']
"So I entered the competition and the art teacher said, ‘They don’t want people like you.’",['Declarative Clause']
" And uh, I stopped drawing ever since then. ",['Declarative Clause']
Wow. ,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"It, it, it hurt.",['Declarative Clause']
How old were you?,['Interrogative Clause']
I might’ve been 13. ,['Declarative Clause']
 Hmm. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, people would say, like, ‘You know, you’re gonna end up in jail,’ or, ‘You’re not gonna ever become anything’ or anything like that.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I was, ‘I’m gonna prove them wrong.",['Declarative Clause']
I need to go somewhere.,['Declarative Clause']
 I need more than this.’,['Declarative Clause']
And I went to New York.,['Declarative Clause']
" And I slept in hallways, and I slept in the subways, and I slept in Grand Central Station.",['Declarative Clause']
"I really couldn’t read and write very well, and, uh, when I did have jobs, I usually weren’t able to keep those jobs. ",['Declarative Clause']
And then I learned to read and write by forcing myself to read an encyclopedia.,['Declarative Clause']
And I applied to go to an art school.,['Declarative Clause']
" I would like to hear more about how you built the confidence to pursue an artistic career, which I see as quite risky. ",['Declarative Clause']
"It was a little scary, but because Mommy did so much supporting us, it wasn’t as scary as if I was the only breadwinner.",['Declarative Clause']
And my joke was always that I did all the cooking and the sewing. ,['Declarative Clause']
And Mommy did the brickwork and the plumbing. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And when you girls were growing up, I made it a point that we would always have family meals on the weekend. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I wanted to raise my girls as really strong, powerful women",['Declarative Clause']
"I would always say, ‘What can I do? As a parent, to make your life better?’ ",['Interrogative Clause']
"You girls would say, ‘I didn’t like when you raised your voice.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
And then I would learn to not be so tough on you. ,['Declarative Clause']
"But you’re navigating the world very well, all of you.",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m 38, the age that you were when you had me.",['Declarative Clause']
What advice do you have for me? ,['Interrogative Clause']
The sad thing about human beings is that we tend to remember the unhappy things. ,['Declarative Clause']
And I think my advice to you is just try to be happy.,['Imperative Clause']
The longest life is short.,['Declarative Clause']
"Miranda Duschack and Mimo Davis’ have been farming together since 2012, supplying flowers in the St. Louis area.",['Declarative Clause']
At StoryCorps Miranda and Mimo told their own love story as the first lesbian couple married in Missouri.,['Declarative Clause']
We met at work.,['Declarative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
At our day job.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then we decided to farm together…fell in love, got married, at a spiritual ceremony where we jumped the broom because we couldn’t legally be married.",['Declarative Clause']
And then the second wedding was in 2014 to be legally married,['Declarative Clause']
Right,['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember this?,['Interrogative Clause']
When we had August. ,['Declarative Clause']
"Do you remember how I pushed August out, ok…",['Declarative Clause']
"What do you mean, do I remember that?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. But they didn’t know how to fill out the birth certificate.,['Declarative Clause']
 I do remember that.,['Declarative Clause']
"o, I was making a fact sheet to leave at the nurse’s station about how to register. Um…",['Declarative Clause']
 It’s okay. It’s okay. You can have you some tears.,['Declarative Clause']
"I just felt like we were total freaks, man.",['Declarative Clause']
"We weren’t freaks, we were just firsts.",['Declarative Clause']
We were just first.,['Declarative Clause']
And it was really embarrassing for me that we fought so hard to get married and then we got divorced. ,['Declarative Clause']
" But, you know, that was part of the rights that we fought for.",['Declarative Clause']
"I know. I mean, I would say that to people, You know, it…",['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s all part of the package, right? ",['Interrogative Clause']
You get to be married and then you get to be divorced. I,['Declarative Clause']
" Right. I was like, just like straight people. ",['Declarative Clause']
Just like straight people [laughs] Right. ,['Declarative Clause']
I can get divorced. I can get divorced. It didn’t necessarily pan out the way we thought it would be…,['Declarative Clause']
 But we’re still in it. We’re still farming partners,['Declarative Clause']
 We’re raising a beautiful son.,['Declarative Clause']
These are gorgeous flowers sitting in front of us. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And Mimo Davis, I’m going to say right now, I still really love you and care about you.",['Declarative Clause']
"Of course, of course, I love you and care about you too. ",['Declarative Clause']
I mean that was never in question for me.,['Declarative Clause']
"We are both really, in our hearts and souls and deep down, totally committed to each other, and that’s why we work through all the real stuff. ",['Declarative Clause']
And I see that as a win.,['Declarative Clause']
"And now – a love letter to a family, recorded during a father’s final days. ",['Declarative Clause']
Sohaib Sultan was a Muslim Chaplain at Princeton University.,['Declarative Clause']
" And in 2020, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.",['Declarative Clause']
"He wanted to record with his wife Arshe to leave something behind for their 3 year old daughter Radiyya, who they adopted from Pakistan.",['Declarative Clause']
"You and I would stay up till 12 o’clock at night, waiting to make that phone call to Pakistan, reminding them that we were inquiring about a child. ",['Declarative Clause']
"And they would always say, ‘There’s no child for you.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I’ve wanted to be a father since I was a little kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I think hearing those words night after night, it was sad.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, the moment they said, ‘We have a baby for you,’ I just remember this feeling of joy. ",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. ,['Declarative Clause']
Seeing her for the first time and holding her was just the most gorgeous moment of my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"So, do you remember the day when you got your full diagnosis?",['Interrogative Clause']
"They called and they said, ‘You probably have a year to live.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
But It didn’t feel like all bad news. ,['Declarative Clause']
Hmm.,['Declarative Clause']
"Like, think about the 40 years that God has given me. ",['Declarative Clause']
What a beautiful life.,['Declarative Clause']
What a purposeful life.,['Declarative Clause']
What a blessed life.,['Declarative Clause']
"But, Radiyya is always asking, ‘Are you better now?’",['Interrogative Clause']
" You know, I say, ‘Abba is not going to get better.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
"And when she says, ‘But then I’ll cry and I’ll cry.’ ",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember saying to her, ‘Aap insaan ho. Ronaa theek hay.’",['Declarative Clause']
"You’re a human being, so it’s okay to cry, to be sad.",['Declarative Clause']
And you’ve told me that one of the hardest things you imagine is explaining to her where I am.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, When she wakes up in the morning and she looks over to our bed and says, ‘Where’s Abba?’",['Declarative Clause']
And you’re in the bathroom.,['Declarative Clause']
I can’t but think about that moment when I’m going to have to answer that differently. ,['Declarative Clause']
That’s going to be a hard one for me. ,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I feel a lot of sorrow in my heart thinking about that moment.",['Declarative Clause']
 Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"But, even though I won’t be there physically, just know that I’ll be there spiritually. ",['Declarative Clause']
You won’t be alone,['Declarative Clause']
"So many people have said, ‘We’re praying for a miracle.’",['Declarative Clause']
But I always chuckle at that because I feel like my entire life has been a miracle. ,['Declarative Clause']
And one of them is finding you. ,['Declarative Clause']
"What you’ve done for me, waking up in the middle of the night, almost every night for the past three months, because I’m in pain.",['Declarative Clause']
"Those are the things that I hope Radiyya really knows, that that’s how you took care of me.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
 You know I’m just grateful for each moment that we get.,['Declarative Clause']
"My hope is that Radiyya will live life beautifully, no matter how long God gives her. ",['Declarative Clause']
And you are especially going to teach her what it means to take life as a gift and to live it out every day.,['Declarative Clause']
Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…,['Declarative Clause']
"When I was seventeen, I got pregnant. ",['Declarative Clause']
And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.,['Declarative Clause']
Wow.,['Exclamatory Clause']
 I just wasn’t ready for that.,['Declarative Clause']
 I’m sure.,['Declarative Clause']
 I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s something I can’t make better for you.,['Declarative Clause']
And I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but… you’ll be okay…,['Declarative Clause']
They came back in 2023.,['Declarative Clause']
" At 88, Jackie’s health was declining… Realizing his mom was nearing the end of life… Scott wanted to do one more interview… ",['Declarative Clause']
I cannot believe 15 years have passed. ,['Declarative Clause']
 I don’t have any more revelations to unleash on you.,['Declarative Clause']
And now I have an old person’s voice. It cracks…,['Declarative Clause']
But I still don’t think of myself as old.,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back. ",['Declarative Clause']
But that doesn’t keep me from doing it. ,['Declarative Clause']
"The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot.",['Declarative Clause']
"He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.",['Declarative Clause']
But my world is really getting smaller. ,['Declarative Clause']
Words don’t come that easily to me now.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s really scary.,['Declarative Clause']
"The other day, I couldn’t remember my cell phone number. ",['Declarative Clause']
"I recognize this is part of getting not older but old, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
" Yeah… You know in our first interview I had said, uh… it scares me imagining life without you, and it doesn’t so much scare me anymore. ",['Declarative Clause']
"But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it. ",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.",['Declarative Clause']
So when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone… ,['Declarative Clause']
"It feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice. ",['Declarative Clause']
" One of the things every parent wants to know is just, how happy are you with your life?",['Interrogative Clause']
I’m very happy about my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.",['Declarative Clause']
"I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you… There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that. You can have great friends or loved ones, but it’s not the same.",['Declarative Clause']
"In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV.",['Declarative Clause']
And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Declarative Clause']
You know what the biggest joy was?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Finding a smile in that small, sick child.",['Declarative Clause']
That just made my week.,['Declarative Clause']
During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Declarative Clause']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work.",['Declarative Clause']
Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Declarative Clause']
"We missed every single dinner date, every movie.",['Declarative Clause']
And that led into a thirty year relationship.,['Declarative Clause']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Declarative Clause']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses.",['Declarative Clause']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother.",['Declarative Clause']
And we’d leave bouquets of roses at their door.,['Declarative Clause']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Declarative Clause']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Declarative Clause']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Declarative Clause']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s not the glitz.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s the simple touches.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence.",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
You see everything as an opportunity because you’re here.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you really believe and you live – if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.",['Declarative Clause']
I can guarantee it.,['Declarative Clause']
"Over the last year, Mary Johnson-Roy has been getting a steady stream of visitors…",['Declarative Clause']
all there to basically say one thing…,['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, Mary.",['Declarative Clause']
I love you.,['Declarative Clause']
I thank you so much just for being in my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"I love you, sister Mary.",['Declarative Clause']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Declarative Clause']
Mary lives in Minneapolis.,['Declarative Clause']
And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide.,['Declarative Clause']
"If it wasn’t for Mary, I don’t know where I would be as a grieving mother.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, I know that I wouldn’t be here.",['Declarative Clause']
"Mary’s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.",['Declarative Clause']
But there’s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work…,['Declarative Clause']
Her connection to the man who killed her son…,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Mary Johnson.,['Declarative Clause']
I am Oshea Israel.,['Declarative Clause']
My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I’m her second son.,['Declarative Clause']
"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m Jasmyn Morris…,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
This week… a story you have to hear to believe.,['Declarative Clause']
"Let’s start at the beginning… in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis…",['Declarative Clause']
"My son, Laramiun, was intelligent.",['Declarative Clause']
Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level.,['Declarative Clause']
"He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy.",['Declarative Clause']
"He grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.",['Declarative Clause']
Fast forward to 1993…when Laramiun was 20…,['Declarative Clause']
"He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that’s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.",['Declarative Clause']
"One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time.",['Declarative Clause']
They got into a fight… and Oshea shot and killed him.,['Declarative Clause']
Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.,['Declarative Clause']
"And over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son.",['Declarative Clause']
And after a decade of trying to find peace… she decided to try something different… to visit Oshea in prison.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s Regina Irwin, one of Mary’s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day…",['Declarative Clause']
"As Mary was walking up to go to the prison, she stopped and she looked at me, and she said, “Regina, I can’t do it.”",['Declarative Clause']
And Mary was bending down almost like she was in labor.,['Declarative Clause']
"And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom.",['Declarative Clause']
"And when she came out, she had prayed… and she was ready to go in.",['Declarative Clause']
"As we were sitting at the table to meet Oshea, they had left a pitcher of water but they didn’t leave a glass for the man that had taken her son’s life",['Declarative Clause']
And Mary said “I will not sit here and not allow him to have a glass that he can drink water from just like everyone else here.”,['Declarative Clause']
And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink.,['Declarative Clause']
We’ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next.,['Declarative Clause']
This is from a conversation they had in 2011… shortly after Oshea finished serving his sentence.,['Declarative Clause']
You and I met at Stillwater Prison.,['Declarative Clause']
"I wanted to know if you were in the same mindset of what I remembered from court, where I wanted to go over and hurt you.",['Declarative Clause']
But you were not that 16-year-old.,['Declarative Clause']
You were a grown man.,['Declarative Clause']
I shared with you about my son.,['Declarative Clause']
And he became human to me.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, when I met you it was like, ok, this guy is real.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can– just hug you like I would my own mother, you know",['Declarative Clause']
"After you left the room, I began to say: ”I just hugged the man that murdered my son.” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you– I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you. ",['Declarative Clause']
As far as receiving forgiveness from you– sometimes I still don’t know how to take it because I haven’t totally forgiven myself yet.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s something that I’m learning from you – I won’t say that I have learned yet– because it’s still a process that I’m going through.,['Declarative Clause']
I treat you as I would treat my son.,['Declarative Clause']
And our relationship is beyond belief.,['Declarative Clause']
We live next door to one another.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
So you can see what I’m doing– you know first hand.,['Declarative Clause']
Uh-huh…,['Exclamatory Clause']
We actually bump into each other all the time leaving in and out of the house.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, our conversations, they come from ”Boy, how come you ain’t called over here to check on me in a couple of days? You ain’t even asked me if I need my garbage to go out!”",['Declarative Clause']
Uh-huh,['Exclamatory Clause']
I find those things funny because it’s a relationship with a mother for real.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, my natural son is no longer here.",['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t see him graduate. ,['Declarative Clause']
Now you’re going to college.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ll have the opportunity to see you graduate.,['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t see him getting married.,['Declarative Clause']
"Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to experience that with you. ",['Declarative Clause']
Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation.,['Declarative Clause']
It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.,['Declarative Clause']
You still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you– it’s amazing.,['Declarative Clause']
"I know it’s not an easy thing, you know, to be able to share our story together.",['Declarative Clause']
"Even with us sitting here looking at each other right now, I know it’s not an easy thing.",['Declarative Clause']
So I admire that you can do this,['Declarative Clause']
"I love you, lady.",['Declarative Clause']
"I love you too, son.",['Declarative Clause']
After that interview aired on NPR… Mary and Oshea continued sharing their story far beyond Minneapolis.,['Declarative Clause']
"They hit the road… visiting churches, synagogues, and prisons…=",['Declarative Clause']
We were invited to a lot of different places.,['Declarative Clause']
"We’ve had a lot of moments, us walking through the airports together, trying to figure out where we’re going.",['Declarative Clause']
"And as we share our story, we still get to hear each other’s parts which brings us even more closer.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it seemed like the mission kind of took off, even to the point where it grew its own legs and started running.",['Declarative Clause']
They were on every national media outlet you can think of and international too.,['Declarative Clause']
She spoke at conferences around the world on love and forgiveness and met with world leaders.,['Declarative Clause']
President Barack Obama even thanked her for her service.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all because of how Mary has helped other families who have lost children to homicide.,['Declarative Clause']
"She started an organization in 2005 called From Death to Life… that provides healing groups for mothers on both sides of a tragedy, and encourages forgiveness when mothers are ready.",['Declarative Clause']
And through her work… she met the love of her life… a man named Ed Roy. ,['Declarative Clause']
"When my first-born and my one and only son was murdered, my daughters had asked me to go to the church to hear you speak.",['Declarative Clause']
"I wasn’t ready for the forgiveness part, but I was at a loss.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like I shared with you, I thought God took my boy and was punishing me for my own crimes.",['Declarative Clause']
I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old.,['Declarative Clause']
"But with you being there, I saw hope.",['Declarative Clause']
You took me under your wing; that’s why I called you my angel.,['Declarative Clause']
"Then I remember, I had that dream — that was just before our wedding.",['Declarative Clause']
"And your son was saying, ”Yeah, Mom! Alright!” You know, ”Right on!” ",['Declarative Clause']
"And my son was saying, ”Yeah, Dad. ‘Bout time you got it right!”",['Declarative Clause']
"As the years and time goes by, you know where I’ve been.",['Declarative Clause']
You know where I hurt.,['Declarative Clause']
And I know you take care of me when I’m not doing well.,['Declarative Clause']
The anniversary is coming up of my son’s murder and I’m grateful to have someone there that has experienced the same thing that I have.,['Declarative Clause']
That empty hole is always going to be there in our hearts.,['Declarative Clause']
"But I feel like when we together and we able to listen to one another’s heartbeats, it says a lot.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m thankful; I really am.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re a good man.,['Declarative Clause']
They recorded that interview in 2017.,['Declarative Clause']
"But recently, Ed has had to care for Mary in an entirely different way.",['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Imperative Clause']
10 years after we first met Mary… she was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia… sometimes described as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s all rolled into one.,['Declarative Clause']
"And her husband, Ed, has been her main caretaker.",['Declarative Clause']
Just a few months ago… the two of them sat down for another interview.,['Declarative Clause']
There was a lot of things that neither one of us didn’t understand.,['Declarative Clause']
"It was things like leaving something on the stove, parking your car a few houses down the street.",['Declarative Clause']
"And as it progressed, we started understanding together what we was up against.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like, when you started seeing things — the invisible people.",['Declarative Clause']
"And we talked about it, honey.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, we made humor out of them.",['Declarative Clause']
We call them the little people,['Declarative Clause']
Like when you had several bowls of cereal out and you was feeding them.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “You giving all my Cap’n Crunch to the little people. What about me?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And you started laughing, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
We have so many moments.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I need to write them down.",['Declarative Clause']
They are written down.,['Declarative Clause']
"They are written down in our hearts, honey.",['Declarative Clause']
Sometimes I think about when people say that a mind is a terrible thing to waste. ,['Declarative Clause']
…to waste. yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
But you know what?,['Interrogative Clause']
The heart is the terrible thing to waste.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, don’t think about just the memory things; we’re here to remember for each other.",['Declarative Clause']
Don’t worry about the reading because I’m here and read to you. ,['Declarative Clause']
How many men would do the things that you do as far as taking care of me?,['Interrogative Clause']
Like putting on my shoes today.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s what it’s all about.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, it’s about us taking care of one another.",['Declarative Clause']
"You’ve given me, Mary, a reason for living.",['Declarative Clause']
"I always told you that, though.",['Declarative Clause']
Uh-huh.,['Exclamatory Clause']
So that’s what I see you doing and giving to other people is hope.,['Declarative Clause']
You have to have some kind of hope to hold on to.,['Declarative Clause']
"When you don’t have that, you don’t have nothing.",['Declarative Clause']
"So, it’s true.",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s true what they say about when, uh, when they say wait on God, that he’ll send you that person.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, he knew what was in my heart.",['Declarative Clause']
Wow.,['Exclamatory Clause']
I love you.,['Declarative Clause']
I love you.,['Declarative Clause']
When word of Mary’s illness started to circulate among the families she’s helped… that’s when the visits we told you about earlier began…,['Declarative Clause']
You’ve got a full slate of visitors for today.,['Declarative Clause']
Why are you saying somebody wants to come and sit and talk to me?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Oh Mary, the world would be lined up if they were invited.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s Brian Mogren.,['Declarative Clause']
"One of Mary’s close friends and the Director of the St. Jane House, where Mary’s healing groups have been meeting for more than 15 years.",['Declarative Clause']
He started hosting “Thursdays with Mary” … so family and friends… including those Mary has helped… can now help her remember her impact.,['Declarative Clause']
And at Mary’s request… Brian’s been recording these conversations.,['Declarative Clause']
"When I saw Brian’s note about meeting with you on Thursdays, I’m like, Oh, let me get my name on that list.",['Declarative Clause']
Cause I want to see my friend.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. I’m so glad that you did.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s Mary’s longtime friend Gwen Chandler.,['Declarative Clause']
"Baby, you will never have any idea how much you’ve influenced people’s lives.",['Declarative Clause']
And people will be saying your name for generations and generations. ,['Declarative Clause']
"I met someone recently, her brother was murdered when she was younger, and she wants to meet the person who killed her brother. ",['Declarative Clause']
Michele Braley is a social worker who was also with Mary at the prison the day that Mary met Oshea… And they’ve been friends ever since…,['Declarative Clause']
"And she said, partly, she had the courage to do that because she knew of your story and that you met Oshea.",['Declarative Clause']
She’s never met you but you gave her courage.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, we don’t know all the lives we impact, do we?",['Interrogative Clause']
"You know, but I wanted to get a chance to tell you that, Mary.",['Declarative Clause']
And despite her illness…Mary’s still been helping to run her healing group for mothers every other Saturday…,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Constance Styles and my son Dante Gray was murdered in 1994.,['Declarative Clause']
Well I’m Ebony Robinson.,['Declarative Clause']
"My son’s name is Andre Riley Jr and I lost him July 3rd, 2016.",['Declarative Clause']
"My son was murdered in 2016, December 25th.",['Declarative Clause']
My name is Angel Cradle.,['Declarative Clause']
The loss of my son Dewayne Tyson Sr. happened in 2007 and the loss of my grandson Dewayne Tyson Jr. happened in 2018.,['Declarative Clause']
"My name is Ann and my son, Maurice Wilson, was killed October the sixth, 1997. ",['Declarative Clause']
"My name is Princess Titus and my son, Anthony Titus, was hit by a bullet intended for another child two weeks after his 16th birthday, right before the fireworks on July 4th, 2010.",['Declarative Clause']
Some of the mothers who were there this particular day… turned the tables on Mary…,['Declarative Clause']
"Do you mind if we spend some time sharing with you, Mother Mary, what you mean to us?",['Interrogative Clause']
Amen,['Exclamatory Clause']
I remember calling Mary around Mother’s Day.,['Declarative Clause']
"She said, this is just how it gets around Mother’s Day and holidays are gonna be like that.",['Declarative Clause']
So to have a woman who did walk that walk to let me know that I was not crazy and that we were not alone.,['Declarative Clause']
Loneliness doesn’t help grief and Mary did not allow us to be lonely.,['Declarative Clause']
"So we’re forever grateful to you, Ms. Mary.",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s not a happy situation, but we are blessed to be able to have you as our shepherd.",['Declarative Clause']
"Ooh, sister Mary, you mean the world to me.",['Declarative Clause']
I admire you so much.,['Declarative Clause']
"No matter how hard things have been for you lately, you are still here teaching us and showing us what true love is.",['Declarative Clause']
I think we all in tears around the table now.,['Declarative Clause']
"So Mary, thank you for modeling… shining your little light everywhere you go.",['Declarative Clause']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Declarative Clause']
"Love you, ladies.",['Declarative Clause']
We love you.,['Declarative Clause']
"Appreciate you so much, you don’t know.",['Declarative Clause']
But for all that’s happened over the past year… there was one person who hadn’t had this kind of conversation with Mary yet… Oshea.,['Declarative Clause']
Her illness has affected him too. It’s hard to see this woman who has meant so much to him declining.,['Declarative Clause']
"She’s not able to travel anymore or share their story together, which was such a big part of his life.",['Declarative Clause']
It gave him purpose.,['Declarative Clause']
"So as much as she still means to him, he’s been hesitant to talk with her directly about her health.",['Declarative Clause']
"But finally, this summer, Oshea decided to sit down with Mary again… and StoryCorps was there to record it.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well Mary, it’s been 12 years since we sat down for our first StoryCorps interview and it’s more emotional for me this time.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, with everything that we’ve been through and we’ve dealt with and everything that’s going on now.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, it hurts to see.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m used to the lady that fusses at me all the time.,['Declarative Clause']
But you’re strong and you’re going to fight for whatever you believe in.,['Declarative Clause']
And I still see you fighting.,['Declarative Clause']
 I’m glad to see you.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m glad to see how you’re doing.,['Declarative Clause']
So I thank God for that chance today.,['Declarative Clause']
A lot has changed.,['Declarative Clause']
"I, myself, have two children: my son, he’s three.",['Declarative Clause']
And a little girl.,['Declarative Clause']
She’s how old now?,['Interrogative Clause']
She’s six years old now.,['Declarative Clause']
I remember when she was born you helped me get the car seat for her.,['Declarative Clause']
"But since we were living next door to each other, you left me for another fella.",['Declarative Clause']
His name is Ed,['Declarative Clause']
I remember when I first got wind of you and Ed going out on dates.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m like, wait, what’s going on?",['Interrogative Clause']
You was mine.,['Declarative Clause']
"But you all blessed me with the opportunity to not only be present in the wedding but to walk you down the aisle, that was, like, again, your words: beyond belief.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m proud of you.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve been proud for a while.,['Declarative Clause']
It has been an amazing journey.,['Declarative Clause']
"From a hug to you becoming a grandmother through me with my kids, to you just being a beacon of light to a lot of people.",['Declarative Clause']
"On our last interview we ended it with me saying “I love you, lady.”",['Declarative Clause']
And I still feel the same way.,['Declarative Clause']
Mary’s still living at home with Ed… and goes to a daytime memory care center three times a week.,['Declarative Clause']
Brian has set up a GoFundMe to help support them.,['Declarative Clause']
But one thing is clear… even as Mary’s memory dims… her light does not.,['Declarative Clause']
"This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine, yeah.",['Declarative Clause']
This little light of mine…,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I’m gonna let it shine.",['Declarative Clause']
"Let it shine, let it shine.",['Imperative Clause']
Let it shine.,['Imperative Clause']
Everywhere I go.,['Declarative Clause']

I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. ,['Declarative Clause']
Join us again next week for our final episode… as we wrap up this special series…,['Imperative Clause']
"As always, thanks for listening.",['Declarative Clause']
"We’ve mentioned a lot of numbers over the past few episodes… 27,000 interviews on the mobile tour… 17,000 interviews in just one day when we released the app.",['Declarative Clause']
But StoryCorps doesn’t just care about numbers…,['Declarative Clause']
WHO records interviews is just as important as how many we collect.,['Declarative Clause']
If we’re building an archive of American voices… we need to make sure that the archive reflects who actually lives here in the United States.,['Declarative Clause']
So while StoryCorps is open to anyone who wants to do an interview… we’ve worked to make sure that stories and voices that don’t often get included in the historical record ARE captured in the StoryCorps archive.,['Declarative Clause']
We call these efforts “initiatives”… you’ve heard about one already – StoryCorps Griot.,['Declarative Clause']
"There’s been quite a lot… like, Historias… or Military voices…",['Declarative Clause']
Our 9/11 initiative,['Declarative Clause']
We did one for people with Memory Loss…,['Declarative Clause']
…and another inviting immigrants to record…,['Declarative Clause']
But on this episode… we’re going to focus on just one of the many that we’ve done… our collection of LGBTQ voices… called StoryCorps OutLoud…,['Declarative Clause']
To be in the service for my country is the greatest thing I thought I did but I was kicked out for being homosexual.,['Declarative Clause']
When I first came out they didn’t have the words that they have today.,['Declarative Clause']
"So, attempting to tell your extraordinarily loving blue-collar parents that you were transgender was tantamount to telling them I was from Jupiter.",['Declarative Clause']
"We got married at the veterans home and we said, ’If you came to see the bride, you’re out of luck!’",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember that?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yes, of course!",['Declarative Clause']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris. From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
"So we thought if we’re telling the story of StoryCorps this season, recording and sharing stories from LGTBQ folks has always been a part of that work and so why is that built into your fabric as a documentary radio producer and the founder of StoryCorps?",['Interrogative Clause']
"It’s always been an issue that’s, you know, close to my heart.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m the proud son of a gay dad.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s Dave Isay… Jasmyn recently sat down with him to talk about the origins of OutLoud.,['Declarative Clause']
"My dad was named Richard Isay, and he was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst.",['Declarative Clause']
"For many years, he saw only gay patients and was kind of a revolutionary in the psychoanalytic world in saying that homosexuality was not a disease and advocating in the work he did for helping LGBTQ folks find love.",['Declarative Clause']
So that was his mission in life.,['Declarative Clause']
I accidentally discovered he was gay when I was 21 and our nuclear family exploded.,['Declarative Clause']
"Despite, you know, many hints and clues, I was taken completely by surprise.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I was really unhappy about a lot of things, uh, and confused about a lot of things.",['Declarative Clause']
And I withdrew from my dad for a while and it was about that time that I started making radio documentaries.,['Declarative Clause']
"At some point after my dad came out, he did tell me the story of the Stonewall riots, which I knew nothing about.",['Declarative Clause']
And it was just a year or two later that I made my first radio documentary and I decided to make it on Stonewall.,['Declarative Clause']
"It was the first oral history of people who had been at Stonewall, believe it or not.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember on that night, when we saw the riot police, all of us drag queens, we linked arms like the Rockettes and sang the song we used to sing.",['Declarative Clause']
“We are the village girls. We wear our hair in curls. We wear our dungarees above our nelly-knees” and the police went crazy hearing that and they just immediately rushed us.,['Declarative Clause']
We gave one kick and fled.,['Declarative Clause']
A lot of these folks had never been interviewed before about what had happened on that day.,['Declarative Clause']
And I was very interested in what life was like before Stonewall.,['Declarative Clause']
"Sylvia Rivera, who’s kind of known as the Rosa Parks of the Stonewall movement, became one of my best friends and was the centerpiece of this radio documentary, which was named Remembering Stonewall, and I dedicated it to my dad.",['Declarative Clause']
The era before Stonewall was a hard era.,['Declarative Clause']
"There was always the gay bashings on the drag queens by heterosexual men, women, and the police.",['Declarative Clause']
"We learned to live with it because it was part of the lifestyle at that time, I guess, but none of us were very happy about it.",['Declarative Clause']
"In some ways, was that you trying to figure out this time in your life where there was a secret, like, life before your dad coming out?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
I was very interested to understand what he had gone through.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, once he came out, I had found out things like, you know, he had been entrapped in a restroom, and he had to beg the cops not to put his name in the paper and, you know, destroy his life.",['Declarative Clause']
"And he had been a rising star in the world of psychoanalysts, and that star was completely extinguished the minute he came out.",['Declarative Clause']
"He was shunned and, you know, refused positions and he was very moved by the fact that I had made this documentary.",['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, it was me making an effort to understand him.",['Declarative Clause']
"And, um, that was the beginning of our rebuilding our relationship with each other.",['Declarative Clause']
"Many, many, many years after that, I started StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
And I guess you could say that there was something about not being crazy about secrets in our lives that was part of the motivation behind starting StoryCorps – giving people the chance to say the important things to the people who are most important to us. ,['Declarative Clause']
And that included Dave.,['Declarative Clause']
Here he is talking with his dad in 2004….,['Declarative Clause']
What truly was the happiest moment of your life?,['Interrogative Clause']
I think I am happier now than I’ve ever been in my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"So it’s, um, happiness is a continuing process.",['Declarative Clause']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
Where am I going?,['Interrogative Clause']
I don’t think much about that.,['Declarative Clause']
You think about dying?,['Interrogative Clause']
All the time.,['Declarative Clause']
Are you scared of dying?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s, uh, it’s more an absence of that.",['Declarative Clause']
What do you think is the most important thing that you’ve accomplished in your life?,['Interrogative Clause']
What are you proudest of?,['Interrogative Clause']
Very proud of you kids.,['Declarative Clause']
I am very proud of the work I’ve done and I am proud of being able to turn my life around and make it into a happy and good one.,['Declarative Clause']
Were you unhappy when I was a kid?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I think I was happy when you were a kid.",['Declarative Clause']
And I was a good father and I loved having kids.,['Declarative Clause']
You think I was a good father?,['Interrogative Clause']
I think you were a good father.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re still a good father.,['Declarative Clause']
My dad got sick in 2012 on a Friday.,['Declarative Clause']
He was diagnosed with cancer and he died the next week.,['Declarative Clause']
"And he actually died on the anniversary of Stonewall on June 28th, 2012.",['Declarative Clause']
"At the memorial service, I announced that in honor of my dad, we would be recording stories of people who were alive before Stonewall and that’s where it all began.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then, you know how I am— ",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m like a dog with a piece of steak, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
"After my dad died, there was no way that this thing wasn’t gonna get done, if it killed me.",['Declarative Clause']
"And you know, that’s the way I, I guess, that I deal with, you know, grief or, or any issues, is that I just stay focused on StoryCorps and get something new done.",['Declarative Clause']
"I decided, you know, come hell or high water, we were going to do this program, which we named OutLoud.",['Declarative Clause']
It launched in June 2014… LGTBQ people from all walks of life came in to tell stories of love… loss… resiliency and creativity… and… family.,['Declarative Clause']
So in keeping with Dave’s story… we’re spending this episode hearing conversations about family…,['Declarative Clause']
This first one is set in a small farming town in Washington State… where Patrick Haggerty was growing up in the 1950s.,['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps he told his daughter, Robin, about something that happened in high school.",['Declarative Clause']
There was an assembly that day and Patrick was going to perform.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m riding to school with my oldest brother, and on the way to school, I’m putting glitter all over my face.",['Declarative Clause']
"And my brother said, ”What in the hell are you doing?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, ”I’m putting on my costume.”",['Declarative Clause']
"And he said, ”Well, I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing that.”",['Declarative Clause']
"So he dropped me off at the school, and he called my dad up, and he said, ”Dad, I think you better get up there. This is not going to look good.”",['Declarative Clause']
So my dad drove up to the high school.,['Declarative Clause']
"And he had his farmer jeans on and they had cow crap on them, and he had his clodhopper boots on.",['Declarative Clause']
"And when I saw him coming, I ducked around the hall and hid from him.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it wasn’t because of what I was wearing, it was because of what he was wearing.",['Declarative Clause']
"So, the assembly goes well, and I climb in the car and I’m riding home with my father.",['Declarative Clause']
"My father says to me, ”I was walking down the hall this morning, and I saw a kid that looked a lot like you ducking around the hall to avoid his dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I know it wasn’t you, cause you would never do that to your dad.”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I squirmed in my seat, and I finally busted out and I said, ”Well dad, did you have to wear your cow-crap jeans to my assembly?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And he said, ”Look, everybody knows I’m a dairy farmer. This is who I am.”",['Declarative Clause']
And he looked me square in the eye.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then he said, ”Now, how bout you? When you’re a full-grown man, who are you gonna go out with at night?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, ”I don’t know.”",['Declarative Clause']
"And he said, ”I think you do know, and it’s not gonna be that McGlaughlin girl that’s been making goo-goo eyes at you but you won’t even pick up the damn telephone.”",['Declarative Clause']
"“Now, I’m gonna tell you something today, and you might not know what to think of it now, but you’re gonna remember when you’re an adult. Don’t sneak. Because if you sneak, like you did today, it means you think you’re doing the wrong thing. And if you run around spending your whole life thinking that you’re doing the wrong thing, then you’ll ruin your immortal soul.”",['Declarative Clause']
"And out of all the things a father in 1959 could have told his gay son, my father tells me to be proud of myself and not sneak.",['Declarative Clause']
My reaction at the time was to get out in the hay field and pretend like I was as much of a man as I could be.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I remember flipping 50-pound bales three feet up into the air going, ”I’m not a queer. What’s he talking about?”",['Declarative Clause']
But he knew where I was headed.,['Declarative Clause']
And he…he knew that making me feel bad about it in any way was the wrong thing to do.,['Declarative Clause']
"I had the patron saint of dads for sissies, and no, I didn’t know at the time, but I know it now.",['Declarative Clause']
"Patrick Haggerty remembering his father, Charles Edward Haggerty.",['Declarative Clause']
Patrick was the founder of Lavender Country – which he called the world’s first openly gay country band.,['Declarative Clause']
He died in 2022.,['Declarative Clause']
How have you seen things change in the way that we talk about and the way we tell stories from the LGBTQ community?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I remember when I did the Stonewall documentary, I was trying to get newspapers to cover it, and I called the major newspaper in New York and said, you know, “we have this documentary, the first oral history of Stonewall, would you like to do a story about it?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And they said, “we don’t do stories about those kinds of people.”",['Declarative Clause']
"I like to think that at StoryCorps, we just, you know, whisper truths in people’s ears.",['Declarative Clause']
And what we try and do is find stories that haven’t been told before that creep up behind you and help you see yourself and someone who you might have thought was very different than you.,['Declarative Clause']
And I think we’ve done that from the first days of StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
"So I think, you know, nothing’s changed.",['Declarative Clause']
"We just, do our best to, you know, help be the vehicle through which people can have their stories told to the world.",['Declarative Clause']
More of those stories coming… after the break.,['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Imperative Clause']
Welcome back – we’re listening to conversations from StoryCorps OutLoud… our initiative to collect and preserve the stories of LGBTQ people across the country.,['Declarative Clause']
M.J. Seide fell in love in the early 1990s.,['Declarative Clause']
Her partner had already been married and raised children… even grandchildren…,['Declarative Clause']
"Which meant that M.J. suddenly became a grandma, too…",['Declarative Clause']
"Here she is with her 12-year-old granddaughter, Genna Alperin.",['Declarative Clause']
How has your life been different than what you thought it was gonna to be?,['Interrogative Clause']
I thought that my life was probably not one that was gonna be worth living.,['Declarative Clause']
"There was this hole that I had all of my life because, I never thought I’d be able to walk along the beach and hold somebody’s hand because I’m gay.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, you know, when I fell in love with Mamommy, I knew that she was my soulmate.",['Declarative Clause']
Do you know what I mean by that?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
I’d never felt that way about anyone before.,['Declarative Clause']
"And um, after she had gotten her divorce from grandpa Jim, she was very upfront with your mom.",['Declarative Clause']
"She told your mom that she was in love, and it was with a woman.",['Declarative Clause']
And that was the first time that anyone was proud to say that they loved me.,['Declarative Clause']
That made me the happiest I’d ever been in my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then, when I got to know your mom and uncle Justin, I knew that I had hit paradise because I now have a family that I can wrap my arms around.",['Declarative Clause']
Is there anything that you’ve never told me that you wanna tell me now?,['Interrogative Clause']
"You know, you and I talk about most things but this is the first time that we’ve ever talked about the fact that I’m gay and I guess what I wanna ask you is, does it embarrass you to have a gay grandma?",['Interrogative Clause']
No,['Declarative Clause']
No?,['Interrogative Clause']
It doesn’t really matter,['Declarative Clause']
It doesn’t.,['Declarative Clause']
It just matters my relationship with you.,['Declarative Clause']
"I always tell you how much I love you, but I don’t know that you can really understand the depth of it, because you’re someone that I never thought would be in my life and I can’t imagine my life without you.",['Declarative Clause']
"You have always been a child that makes up her own mind and, I always knew that you were going to grow up to be a woman that we would all be very, very proud of.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, um.",['Declarative Clause']
You’re one of my favorite grandmas.,['Declarative Clause']
"You do, like, a lot of things with me like ride roller coasters and (GA & MS laugh) play poker (GA & MS laugh) I don’t know what life would be like without you here.",['Declarative Clause']
I love you sweetheart.,['Declarative Clause']
Love you too.,['Declarative Clause']
OutLoud was started to preserve the stories of the pre-Stonewall generation while we still could… but as it’s continued… it’s also documented several other generations… including the youngest one…,['Declarative Clause']
"Gabe Lopez always knew he was a boy, even though his birth certificate said otherwise.",['Declarative Clause']
"When he was 8 years old, Gabe came to StoryCorps in Arizona, where he lives, with his mom Chris, and they talked about how a weekend at camp for transgender kids transformed his life.",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember when things really changed for you?,['Interrogative Clause']
We went to a camp.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I met three best friends — Luke, Brock, and Cooper.",['Declarative Clause']
Brock taught me how to pee standing up.,['Declarative Clause']
"They were all transgender like me, so they all wanted to be boys.",['Declarative Clause']
"And that was huge for you, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s why I say we’re bros.,['Declarative Clause']
We know each other.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you ever get scared about what it’s going to be like to grow up transgender?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I’ve been wondering if when I’m older, a lot of people will try to hurt me or something … or …",['Declarative Clause']
Like if they find out you were born a girl and they have a problem with it?,['Interrogative Clause']
Mhmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
You think they might try to hurt you in some way?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
Were you ever worried about telling me that you were transgender?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
Did you ever try to tell me and then change your mind?,['Interrogative Clause']
Mmhmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
How many times do you think?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I think like, four times.",['Declarative Clause']
Four times?,['Interrogative Clause']
I was worried that you liked me as a girl.,['Declarative Clause']
Because we used to have a lot of fun?,['Interrogative Clause']
Mmhmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Do we still have fun?,['Interrogative Clause']
Mhhmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"So it doesn’t really matter if you’re a boy or a girl, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t know that you were dealing with that on your own.,['Declarative Clause']
"If I’d known I would have tried a little bit harder to have that conversation with you, and maybe start it myself.",['Declarative Clause']
"Um, do you worry about me?",['Interrogative Clause']
I worry about how other people might treat you.,['Declarative Clause']
And it makes me upset to think about what you might have to go through.,['Declarative Clause']
You amaze me every day.,['Declarative Clause']
"And you can tell me anything, anytime, anywhere, and it won’t change how much I love you.",['Declarative Clause']
I’ll always have your back.,['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, mom.",['Declarative Clause']
That conversation was recorded on our mobile tour in 2015…,['Declarative Clause']
"And just this year Gabe, who’s now 16 years old… came back for another conversation.",['Declarative Clause']
"This time with his dad, Julio.",['Declarative Clause']
Did you ever feel jealous that it was my friends who taught me how to pee standing up?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I don’t think so.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I was like, “that takes some talent to be able to do that.”",['Declarative Clause']
"When I first talked to you guys about how I felt, I was young, obviously, but I didn’t know the consequences that people could have for coming out to their parents.",['Declarative Clause']
"We always thought it was just kind of a phase and we told you that, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Mm-hmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
And I remember saying that to you because it happened with my sister.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, my sister was very tomboyish and hanging out with the boys but I noticed something different in you.",['Declarative Clause']
"So when you came out to us, it caught us by surprise, but it wasn’t a big surprise.",['Declarative Clause']
You know what I mean?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"I was really happy that you guys were super supportive, because I know that not many kids get that.",['Declarative Clause']
"We’ve always loved you, no matter what.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like one of the pictures that I cherish, you were in a dress, you were holding a, a toy gun mm-hmm.",['Declarative Clause']
And your Hulk shoes…,['Declarative Clause']
"and I mean, you know,  even though that time was still kind of difficult for you.",['Declarative Clause']
I saw who Gabe was and who he was gonna become in the future.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m always gonna be able to cherish that.,['Declarative Clause']
How would you describe yourself today?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I’m really trying to up my art game, so I can be a tattoo artist.",['Declarative Clause']
I bought you a tattoo gun.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then told you I can be your test dummy and I love it because, for your first tattoo on a person, that came out really good.",['Declarative Clause']
What kind of man do you want to be?,['Interrogative Clause']
The kind of man that can help others see different viewpoints.,['Declarative Clause']
And not specifically that they have to agree with that side but they acknowledge that it’s there.,['Declarative Clause']
What are your hopes for me?,['Interrogative Clause']
I want you to be happy.,['Declarative Clause']
When I leave here I want you to be OK.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all I’m wanting for you.,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t think we have any idea what these stories…what this kind of collection of the wisdom of humanity is going to mean a hundred years from now.,['Declarative Clause']
But it’s a way to pass wisdom from one generation to the next and it shows the best in us.,['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s one of those, you know, those lessons of StoryCorps; just reminds us of the fundamental goodness of humanity.",['Declarative Clause']
"And we have to trust in that, especially, when we go through rough times, like we’re going through today.",['Declarative Clause']
"But you know, that’s a lesson going back to Stonewall and Sylvia Rivera and, you know, the heroes who fought on that night, that you just can’t give up.",['Declarative Clause']
And I do believe that good wins in the end.,['Declarative Clause']

I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started.,['Declarative Clause']
And they would see me again around Christmas time.,['Declarative Clause']
And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again.,['Declarative Clause']
"So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable.",['Declarative Clause']
And as far as you doing the business?,['Interrogative Clause']
You started younger than me.,['Declarative Clause']
As soon as I could walk.,['Declarative Clause']
Even before you were walking.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I…",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.,['Declarative Clause']
"I was literally there since day one. I saw you do it, I was like, ”Ok, I can do this.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"One half of that is, you know, ‘cause he’s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he’s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can’t help.",['Declarative Clause']
I have a sense of usefulness. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m not just saying this, you’re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and…",['Declarative Clause']
That comes from coming from immigrant parents.,['Declarative Clause']
You can never work hard enough.,['Declarative Clause']
"Even when you’re working seven days a week they say, “You’re a little lazy.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Interrogative Clause']
Never.,['Declarative Clause']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, never.",['Declarative Clause']
And when am I gonna retire?,['Interrogative Clause']
One day before your funeral?,['Interrogative Clause']
You know it.,['Declarative Clause']
Yup.,['Declarative Clause']
I would understand.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, yeah.",['Declarative Clause']
You know what I mean?,['Interrogative Clause']
"My father, he hated my business man.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time.",['Declarative Clause']
"But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: ”I’m no genius, but I’m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.”",['Declarative Clause']
I like that.,['Declarative Clause']
"You raised all of us, man.",['Declarative Clause']
"Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.,['Declarative Clause']
Well you do your best kid.,['Declarative Clause']
This is what you do.,['Declarative Clause']
But honestly your best.,['Declarative Clause']
Not just your B.S. best.,['Declarative Clause']
And even if you fail.,['Declarative Clause']
It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re always my barometer.,['Declarative Clause']
You never let anyone down.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s what sets you apart.,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Rob Rigano.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Interrogative Clause']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately. Yes",['Declarative Clause']
Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego.,['Declarative Clause']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Declarative Clause']
He came back to StoryCorps reflect on their conversation.,['Declarative Clause']
"My brother, Robbie loved coming here, and our family had had an Airstream trailer, so taking Robbie to StoryCorps was a natural fit.",['Declarative Clause']
"What’s your earliest memory, Rob?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Wait, what happened?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Declarative Clause']
Into a telephone pole?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
Robbie is what they call developmentally disabled.,['Declarative Clause']
"He knew he had limits, but he had a way of just melting your heart.",['Declarative Clause']
"Do you remember, uh, one time in, Mom’s station wagon,",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I fell out.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah? And what were you doing, playing with the doors while the car was driving?",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, the locks were defected.",['Declarative Clause']
So you weren’t playing with the door handle?,['Interrogative Clause']
No. I think they had trouble with the locks on that particular model car.,['Declarative Clause']
I know you had trouble with the locks,['Declarative Clause']
And then another time I bit a horse. ,['Declarative Clause']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Declarative Clause']
I thought I did?,['Interrogative Clause']
"The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.”",['Declarative Clause']
Besides these shenanigans he ended up working at the Department of Public Works for 30 years.,['Declarative Clause']
"Where he got to walk around the streets picking up litter, cleaning, sweeping.",['Declarative Clause']
And he got to know nearly every resident.,['Declarative Clause']
He was often referred to as “the real mayor” by the people.,['Declarative Clause']
In fact he would go around our neighborhood to look in on our older neighbors.,['Declarative Clause']
"And he would say, “well, who else is going to do it?”",['Declarative Clause']
He just has that sense of what’s right.,['Declarative Clause']
What’s your happiest memory?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Well uh, my happiest memory is when dad took me to learn how to swim.",['Declarative Clause']
But my dad’s a little excitable.,['Declarative Clause']
"Why do you think that is, Rob?",['Interrogative Clause']
I think that’s his nature.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah? Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things?",['Interrogative Clause']
"No no, that’s his nature.",['Declarative Clause']
Rolling cars into trees?,['Interrogative Clause']
I don’t do that anymore.,['Declarative Clause']
"I was listening to this recording with my wife, and she said  “Isn’t it great to hear Robbie being Robbie again?”",['Declarative Clause']
"Because he came down with COVID more than once, And his illness has really taken a toll on his sense of humor.",['Declarative Clause']
He is not as effervescent as he used to be.,['Declarative Clause']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together.,['Declarative Clause']
He is a gem of a guy and we all helped polish him.,['Declarative Clause']
Anything else Rob?,['Interrogative Clause']
I think that’s about it.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
And next year we could have stories about you.,['Declarative Clause']
For 25 years… the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay…,['Declarative Clause']
And if you called in the 1980s… longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone.,['Declarative Clause']
At StoryCorps… she remembered what this work meant to her.,['Declarative Clause']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building.,['Declarative Clause']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows.",['Declarative Clause']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.",['Declarative Clause']
"It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy.",['Declarative Clause']
But it was our place.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, it was beautiful.",['Declarative Clause']
"Typical calls were, I’m coming to New York, what’s the best  bar for lesbians specifically?",['Interrogative Clause']
But then every once in a while you’d get somebody that would call and just want to talk…,['Declarative Clause']
"Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something.",['Declarative Clause']
‘Should I tell my parents? Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’,['Interrogative Clause']
"The suicidal calls we weren’t permitted to take, ‘cause we weren’t trained for that.",['Declarative Clause']
I had a few of those calls.,['Declarative Clause']
"‘Don’t kill yourself, don’t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.’",['Imperative Clause']
"That’s all we could say, really.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.",['Declarative Clause']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Declarative Clause']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14.",['Declarative Clause']
"And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn’t want to be with him.",['Declarative Clause']
And my mother?,['Interrogative Clause']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Declarative Clause']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters.,['Declarative Clause']
"So when I graduated high school, my mother didn’t want me in the house anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, and I was still like just a kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted. But that wasn’t who I was.",['Declarative Clause']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s what people wanted to hear.,['Declarative Clause']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone.",['Declarative Clause']
"When I returned to school, you waited until the other children left the room at the end of the day, and you told me that you were there if I needed you.",['Declarative Clause']
And you bent over and kissed me on the head.,['Declarative Clause']
"It was really the only time someone said to me, ‘I know what you’re feeling, and I know what you’re missing.’",['Declarative Clause']
And I felt that things really would be OK.,['Declarative Clause']
"When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died.",['Declarative Clause']
And you just don’t know how you’re going to go on without that person.,['Declarative Clause']
"Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, ‘Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I’ve never told her that.’",['Declarative Clause']
And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson’s and he was going downhill.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter.",['Declarative Clause']
I was afraid my penmanship wasn’t going to meet your standards.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.",['Declarative Clause']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019.,['Declarative Clause']
"After, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family… Cecile’s daughter, Allison.",['Declarative Clause']
My relationship with you is very important to me.,['Declarative Clause']
"Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn’t know if she was being loved.",['Declarative Clause']
"And when I met you, it made me feel so much better.",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Interrogative Clause']
"To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another…",['Declarative Clause']
"And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.",['Declarative Clause']
It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had.,['Declarative Clause']
It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.,['Declarative Clause']
"We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends.",['Declarative Clause']
And we had that book at her funeral service.,['Declarative Clause']
"So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief…",['Declarative Clause']
Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us.,['Declarative Clause']
And then you realize it’s about what have they left behind.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.",['Declarative Clause']
And that was in a big way John.,['Declarative Clause']
I almost feel like you’re a brother.,['Declarative Clause']
I suspect our mothers have something to do with that.,['Declarative Clause']
They might quite well.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yes, that’s something to do with that, I think.",['Declarative Clause']
So what a gift they gave us.,['Exclamatory Clause']
They certainly did.,['Declarative Clause']
"Let’s go back one more time to one of Dave Isay’s early appearances on the Brian Lehrer show, in New York City. ",['Declarative Clause']
This one is from 2004…,['Declarative Clause']
"We’re trying to create an oral history of America from the bottom up and that’s what we’re getting, everyday people, just regular people talking in the booth and it’s been incredibly gratifying.",['Declarative Clause']
"And so I know you’re a big-think kind of guy, what’s the larger impact that you hope this will have on America if your vision really succeeds in getting a lot of people around America doing this?",['Interrogative Clause']
It’s a project about getting people to listen to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, we live in such a culture of, you know, even when you look at the best seller list, you’ve got these books that are all the way on the right and all the way on the left.",['Declarative Clause']
And it just seems like everybody is screaming at each other.,['Declarative Clause']
There’s just this lack of real honest communication and it’s simply about getting people to sit down and talk to each other and listen.,['Declarative Clause']
So now you’re going to get diehard Democrats and diehard Republicans to the booth to really listen to each other about where their views come from?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Hey, you never know.",['Declarative Clause']
You never know.,['Declarative Clause']
We hope so.,['Declarative Clause']
20 years ago… that sounded like a whimsical idea…,['Declarative Clause']
But that comment would end up being kind of prophetic.,['Declarative Clause']
"In the years since that interview, the divides in this country have grown wider… and the stakes have gotten much, much higher.\n ",['Declarative Clause']
Listen to this StoryCorps participant named John Klinkel… he’s a veteran and he did multiple tours in Afghanistan…,['Declarative Clause']
I was out of the country from 2009 until about March of 2017.,['Declarative Clause']
"When I got back, the country was almost as angry as some of the factions I remember seeing in Afghanistan.",['Declarative Clause']
"It felt like a country that was always on the verge of either tearing itself, apart or picking a fight.",['Declarative Clause']
And I didn’t remember that from when I left.,['Declarative Clause']
So it was very strange for me to come back and feel the anger.,['Declarative Clause']
"If you think of being in a deployed environment, you want to stay in the yellow light, cautious, ready to go but recognizing that things haven’t jumped off just yet.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it kind of felt like that. It felt like, Ooh, we’re in a situation here.",['Declarative Clause']
Who knows what’s going to happen.,['Declarative Clause']
Whenever there’s a national crisis or tragedy of some sort… StoryCorps has always tried to find ways to be helpful.,['Declarative Clause']
"When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks.",['Declarative Clause']
We offered families who had lost someone that day the opportunity to record their memories… to make sure their loved ones wouldn’t be forgotten.,['Declarative Clause']
In earlier episodes you heard about how we brought a Mobile Booth to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina…,['Declarative Clause']
And how we built new technology to help connect people during Covid.,['Declarative Clause']
And so in this final episode we’ll learn what StoryCorps is doing NOW… ,['Declarative Clause']
And where we might go in the future… I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I’m Jasmyn Morris. From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now – celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
That clip youjust  heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US… that’s from an initiative called One Small Step.,['Declarative Clause']
Our effort to address just how divided we’ve become.,['Declarative Clause']
It brings strangers with opposing political beliefs together for a conversation – not to argue about politics… but just to learn about each other’s lives.,['Declarative Clause']
We don’t expect them to or even want them or ask them to agree by the end of the conversation.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s Mary Bess Ser…. she works on One Small Step.,['Declarative Clause']
 We’re not asking people to come to any sort of common ground. We just want people to talk.,['Declarative Clause']
Because… we HAVE stopped talking to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
A lot of us have a tendency to shut out people we don’t agree with… so One Small Step asks us to do the opposite… to actually get to know each other.,['Declarative Clause']
"The basis of the whole conversation is, you know, yes, we probably disagree on most things, but we’re having this conversation anyway.",['Declarative Clause']
"And by the end of it, We’ll see what happens.",['Declarative Clause']
" You know, these days the voices telling us that we’re supposed to hate each other are so loud… and so pervasive… One Small Step really feels like David taking on Goliath… but we’ve never shied from a challenge before…",['Declarative Clause']
And there’s scientific evidence that something like this can make a difference.,['Declarative Clause']
One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.,['Declarative Clause']
The idea is that under very specific circumstances… when people who consider themselves enemies are put together one on one… they can actually come out the other side of that experience understanding and accepting each other… and sometimes they even become friends. ,['Declarative Clause']
One of the keys is that phrase “very specific circumstances” – so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.,['Declarative Clause']
Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other… but One Small Step interviews are between strangers.,['Declarative Clause']
Here’s Mary Bess again…,['Declarative Clause']
The fact that they’re strangers really makes it less threatening.,['Declarative Clause']
So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother – that may or may not be my story –  it’s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there’s no relationship at stake.,['Declarative Clause']
Here’s how it works – people sign up online – there’s a questionnaire that asks them to rate how they feel about social and economic issues… how important religion is in their lives…,['Declarative Clause']
"They can select from a list of terms to identify themselves… things like parent, grandparent or veteran.",['Declarative Clause']
And they write a short bio… describing themselves in their own words – and that gets shared with their interview partner. ,['Declarative Clause']
Then someone from StoryCorps – like Mary Bess – matches them up with a stranger.,['Declarative Clause']
There’s a real person doing the pairing… not an algorithm.,['Declarative Clause']
They don’t see the reason why we’ve matched them.,['Declarative Clause']
"Really they show up to the interview, you know, not knowing at all what to expect, and usually people realize that they’ve come to the table with a lot of assumptions.",['Declarative Clause']
Here’s one example.,['Declarative Clause']
"It comes from Birmingham, Alabama… where Cassandra Adams, a liberal, was paired with David Wilson, a conservative. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Lemme ask you this, when you read my bio…",['Declarative Clause']
Mm-hmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
What did you think?,['Interrogative Clause']
And please be as honest as you feel comfortable because nothing would bother me.,['Imperative Clause']
"Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype— ",['Declarative Clause']
Mm-hmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"She’s probably dyed in the wool democrat, end of story. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Second part was intriguing because you said something along the lines of an open mind and I thought, well this would be interesting.",['Declarative Clause']
When I read your bio I just thought you were a white man.,['Declarative Clause']
I thought I was gonna come in here and just be like… ,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t even know what it was!,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t remember what it was!,['Declarative Clause']
And that’s what’s so interesting to me! Is that I’m just like…,['Declarative Clause']
Stereotype!,['Declarative Clause']
That’s exactly right!,['Exclamatory Clause']
"So I have to admit it because when you walked in the door and I stood up and introduce myself I was like ‘oops, oops, oops.’",['Declarative Clause']
"To have this opportunity to match people, like they’re dating, and there’s always some sort of coincidence that we didn’t even know about.",['Declarative Clause']
"One interview, we found out that both participants, I mean, they couldn’t be more different, but they’re both foster parents, and we didn’t know that.",['Declarative Clause']
"That wasn’t even a point of connection where I thought, oh, they’re so different, but they’re foster parents.",['Declarative Clause']
This will be a great conversation.,['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t even know.,['Declarative Clause']
They had a great time.,['Declarative Clause']
They wanted to go out for coffee afterwards.,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, that really is something, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Because we’re told constantly, talking about the other side, like, oh, those people, we can’t possibly have anything in common with them, and then it’s amazing to hear that there’s almost always something.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, and it can be something completely uninteresting too it could be like, Oh, both of these people are into intermittent fasting, you know, like, (laughs) but they have something to talk about, you know, that, (laughs) and they realize that it’s the shared humanity aspect of it, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
"Here’s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona.",['Declarative Clause']
Their connection… was parenting.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve been stretched and challenged far beyond I knew was possible.,['Declarative Clause']
You know?,['Interrogative Clause']
"And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one?",['Interrogative Clause']
Right?,['Interrogative Clause']
And your heart just seems to have all kinds of elastic in it.,['Declarative Clause']
It doesn’t ever wear out.,['Declarative Clause']
Right?,['Interrogative Clause']
You know?,['Interrogative Clause']
Pretty amazing.,['Exclamatory Clause']
So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?,['Interrogative Clause']
That’s a great question.,['Declarative Clause']
"My dad would say, “Well you can do that if you want. I prefer this.”",['Declarative Clause']
And he let us see that opportunity for ourselves.,['Declarative Clause']
I remember when I told him I wanted to try smoking cigarettes.,['Declarative Clause']
"And he said, “Well, I personally prefer to breathe clean air, but if that’s your choice, then you go for it” and took the excitement out of it.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, you actually told him that.",['Declarative Clause']
Yeah. Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
That you had that relationship you could do that.,['Declarative Clause']
I feel like I lean toward that with my children,['Declarative Clause']
You know I think what a gift your father gave you.,['Declarative Clause']
So I’m very much a daddy’s girl.,['Declarative Clause']
I connected with him.,['Declarative Clause']
He was my junior senior high school principal. So 7th through 12th grade.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when I was going into 7th grade, you know, he made sure he had a conversation with me where he said, “You know, your mom and I think you’re pretty special but, because you’re my daughter, you’re probably going to have few friends and you probably won’t have anybody who will want to date you.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it’s not because you don’t have a lot to offer, but it’s primarily because of whose daughter you are.”",['Declarative Clause']
"The fact that he did that, laid that out for a 12-year-old girl, he set the tone for me to know what the road was going to be like.",['Declarative Clause']
"And we didn’t have a lot of conversations, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
"And I don’t know how often my father ever said I love you, but I know he loved me",['Declarative Clause']
Who knew how that was going to go?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Like you said, it’s unscripted.",['Declarative Clause']
"We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Like that.,['Declarative Clause']
Let me give you a hug.,['Declarative Clause']
"A lot of people think that, Oh, one small step, these conversations, people are going to attack each other, you know, it’s going to get ugly.",['Declarative Clause']
"And honestly, it’s the opposite.",['Declarative Clause']
"Some people don’t want to participate because they say, well, I don’t really know, I’m not really well versed in what’s going on in politics right now.",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s where we say, you know, you don’t have to prepare for this experience.",['Declarative Clause']
"You don’t have to, this isn’t a debate.",['Declarative Clause']
"You don’t need to bring a briefcase full of, you know, the most recent articles.",['Declarative Clause']
"you just bring your life experience and talk about what you care about, what your life has been like and listen to someone else do the same and that’s pretty much it.",['Declarative Clause']
So there ARE some other ways One Small Step interviews are different from standard StoryCorps conversations…,['Declarative Clause']
Each One Small Step interview starts with the participants reading each other’s bios out loud… ,['Declarative Clause']
And then a trained facilitator guides them through the conversation with questions from a list designed specifically for One Small Step.,['Declarative Clause']
"One of the questions is can you describe in your own words, your personal political values?",['Interrogative Clause']
"The way it’s phrased you’re asked to talk about why you care about something, why it’s important to you, why you believe X, Y, or Z.",['Declarative Clause']
So you’re still talking about your own life.,['Declarative Clause']
"You’re still telling stories, you know, how your grandfather influenced you, or, you know, you grew up poor.",['Declarative Clause']
It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right?,['Interrogative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
"And makes it about understanding, which is, like, a completely different approach",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I mean you can still walk out of the room and think, you know, that person everything they stand for is completely wrong, but, somehow, I enjoyed speaking with them, or somehow I kind of respect them.",['Declarative Clause']
"This next conversation comes from Columbus, Georgia… Alton Russell is the former Chair of the Republican party there…",['Declarative Clause']
And he was paired with Wane Hailes… who was the President of the local chapter of the NAACP.,['Declarative Clause']
These guys knew of each other… but they had never spoken before this interview.,['Declarative Clause']
I went to Houston looking for a job in this little old bitty office.,['Declarative Clause']
There was a guy sitting at the desk.,['Declarative Clause']
"He said, um, “What will you do?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Anything as long as it’s legal.”",['Declarative Clause']
"He says, “Good answer. How about 40 dollars a week?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Yes sir.” This was 1961. He said, by the way, “My name is George Bush.” It was George H. W. Bush.",['Declarative Clause']
And he was running for Congress.,['Declarative Clause']
What my job was is I made yard signs with a wooden stake and a piece of poster board and a stencil.,['Declarative Clause']
But you’ve never run for office?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, never have.",['Declarative Clause']
You’ve just been the kingmaker.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, I don’t know about that.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I, no, I never have run.",['Declarative Clause']
What do you do for a living?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Believe it or not, I’m a toilet paper salesman.",['Declarative Clause']
Really?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yes, sir. ",['Declarative Clause']
Two ply?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Two ply, wipe it up, yeah",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve been there 40 years.,['Declarative Clause']
Is that right?,['Interrogative Clause']
"But you’ve done a lot of different things too, and I’m, I’m just wondering how in the world did you wind up in Columbus, Georgia?",['Interrogative Clause']
Did you take a wrong turn? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"I was working for the YMCA, and the YMCA here called and said, “Would I be interested?”",['Declarative Clause']
"But as the president of the NAACP, I can tell you how I got into that.",['Declarative Clause']
"When we were, uh, growing up, about 8 or 9 years old, we were traveling to my grandfather’s house and we stopped at a laundromat.",['Declarative Clause']
"And when we went in,  they said, “We don’t wash black folks clothes here.” ",['Declarative Clause']
Mm-hmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"Of course, they didn’t use black folks word.",['Declarative Clause']
"My father being a preacher, you know, he was cool, but my mother was ready to go off, you know, and we went on to my grandfather’s house and he got on the phone and he called the NAACP.",['Declarative Clause']
"About 30 minutes later, they said, going back up to the laundromat.",['Declarative Clause']
"And the white owner stood in the corner while we washed our clothes, red as a beet.",['Declarative Clause']
"So I’m like, Oh man, that was a memory that’s always been in my mind.",['Declarative Clause']
Sure.,['Declarative Clause']
And how it worked.,['Interrogative Clause']
You know what?,['Interrogative Clause']
I have a good friend of mine.,['Declarative Clause']
"We went to breakfast one morning and when we left this guy that was in the restaurant with us came out and followed me to my truck. And he said, um, “Are you Alton Russell?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Yes, I am.”",['Declarative Clause']
"He says, “Well, I saw you on TV the other day.”",['Declarative Clause']
"He said, “But I got a question. How can you be a Republican and eat breakfast with that black guy?”",['Declarative Clause']
"I said, “What did you say? That guy’s a friend of mine. You’re way off base.”",['Declarative Clause']
"We got things to do, and worrying about whether you’re a man, a woman, black, or white is not what you need to be focusing on.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well I’ll tell you what, I’ve got a whole different view of you.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, my perception was, okay, he’s always going to be over here.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m not going to even talk with him.,['Declarative Clause']
"But this has been, this has been eye opening for me.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, it has to me too.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I can go tell some people, “Hey, Alton’s not that bad.” ",['Declarative Clause']
He’s alright.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s been fun.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m really glad to have met you;,['Declarative Clause']
I sure am.,['Declarative Clause']
People have come to believe that these conversations are possible.,['Declarative Clause']
"So that in and of itself, I think, is an increase in hope.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I don’t know if you can quantify it, hope, but, um, you know, the belief that we can have these conversations, especially in an election year, you know, you wonder, well, is this the right time for one small step?",['Interrogative Clause']
And I think it’s even more important at those times because that’s when we most definitely do not want to talk to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory?,['Interrogative Clause']
That idea that if people from different groups come together 1 on 1… they can start to see each other as human?,['Interrogative Clause']
One Small Step interviews are definitely helping that to happen.,['Declarative Clause']
But the harder thing to make happen… is to have that feeling generalize… to not be just about that one individual you met… but about a whole group… ,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, there’s a social psychologist at Yale, Jennifer Richeson… and she’s been studying One Small Step and the impact it’s having on participants… And she’s finding evidence that… for some people who record with us… this feeling IS beginning to generalize.",['Declarative Clause']
"Sometimes people say, well, I didn’t see fireworks, it didn’t change me, but they really enjoyed the other person’s company and they were surprised by that, or They really felt like they understood each other and that really surprised them.",['Declarative Clause']
It definitely chips away at that us versus them mentality just a little bit.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, that’s why we say it’s one small step.",['Declarative Clause']
It’s not a magic cure.,['Declarative Clause']
We’re not calling it that.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s just One Small Step in the right direction.,['Declarative Clause']
We’ll be back… right after the break.,['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Imperative Clause']
"So, Jasmyn, here we are… the last segment of the final episode of this series.",['Declarative Clause']
We made it…,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, one of the big takeaways for me looking back on these past twenty years… it’s related to what Mary Bess said a few minutes ago… about increasing hope.",['Declarative Clause']
"I think at its root, that’s a big part of what StoryCorps is about… and I don’t mean like cheap greeting card expressions of hope… but the kind of hope that grows out of hard work… and having people surprise you.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step. Earlier this year, in a “Mr Isay Goes to Washington” moment… Dave brought One Small Step to the annual baseball game between members of Congress at Nationals stadium in DC… and he showed a video on the jumbotron challenging them to participate… and some of them actually did…",['Declarative Clause']
"And soon we’re rolling out this new do-it-yourself online version of One Small Step, so that strangers anywhere in the country can record an interview.",['Declarative Clause']
"You could have a person from the bluest county in America getting to know someone from the reddest county… I mean, for me personally at this moment in history… it’s just really incredible to work at a place where the underlying ethos is optimism. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah and I think for me having listened to A LOT of StoryCorps interviews over the years… and it’s really beautiful to hear someone take the time to sit down with another person, especially an elder to capture wisdom from their family…  you know, before it’s lost.",['Declarative Clause']
"But for those of who get to do this work… we’ve been able to listen to thousands of these interviews, thousands of  grandparents… or parents or couples and absorb basically generations of wisdom… And I don’t know if I’ve ever told you this but I actually used to keep a folder of little clips from interviews whenever I heard little gems … that I just wanted to keep for myself, stuff I could use in my own life.",['Declarative Clause']
What a gift.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Very cool.,['Declarative Clause']
Another thing that strikes me is that after 20 years… the basic idea of a StoryCorps interview really hasn’t changed that much… and I mean that in the best way… it’s held up… like no matter what’s going on in the world… this way of taking an hour to connect with somebody… we want it… maybe we even need it.,['Declarative Clause']
And we found something that really helps illustrate that point.,['Declarative Clause']
We dug up the very first SC interview ever recorded… ,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m Dave Isay, and I’m interviewing Sandy Birnbaum, who’s my uncle, my great uncle.",['Declarative Clause']
Great Uncle.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"Sandy, this is a very special session here because, like I said, we’re starting this whole national movement and you’re interview number one.",['Declarative Clause']
"When they spoke in 2003… Sandy’s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before.",['Declarative Clause']
"The first date, she says, “I’ll meet you in the doorway just past the liquor store after work.”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I was standing in the doorway, and it’s inset a little bit.",['Declarative Clause']
"And finally I see this vision of purple coming down the street, a purple hat and a purple coat, and I think she had purple shoes and stockings on, too and uh, it  was so glamorous.",['Declarative Clause']
"I says, What the hell am I, a two bit farm boy?",['Declarative Clause']
This is such a sophisticated woman,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, she’s way beyond me",['Declarative Clause']
"So I turned to the doorway, and I tried to duck out, but the door was locked.",['Declarative Clause']
"If the door was open, it would have ended there and the best thing that…",['Declarative Clause']
"Well anyhow, uh, the door was locked and, uh, we had just so much fun.",['Declarative Clause']
Birdie was the love of your life?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Oh yeah, yeah.",['Declarative Clause']
What did you love about her?,['Interrogative Clause']
You know I’ve never been asked that question.,['Declarative Clause']
Just her warmth.,['Declarative Clause']
She was everything that I wasn’t. ,['Declarative Clause']
"She filled in all the, uh, deficiencies I had, which were considerable, mostly in regard to shyness and to, uh, self confidence and things like that.",['Declarative Clause']
"Everybody loved her, and she was a good person to have with you.",['Declarative Clause']
"Oh God,  I remember…",['Exclamatory Clause']
"Thank you, Sandy",['Declarative Clause']
So let me ask you a question.,['Imperative Clause']
"It is helpful to talk about this, yeah?",['Declarative Clause']
Uh.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Or is it not?,['Interrogative Clause']
Is it damaging to bring up?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Oh, no.. it’s a good feeling.",['Declarative Clause']
"Break out crying or you choke up and you can’t say a word, that’s a good feeling? ",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, it is.",['Declarative Clause']
"Because, you know, you don’t have to pretend that you’re being a brave soul.",['Declarative Clause']
Gutting it through.,['Declarative Clause']
You’re just letting go.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s a good feeling.,['Declarative Clause']
Let me get you home.,['Imperative Clause']
Okay.,['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, Sandy.",['Declarative Clause']
"Hundreds of thousands of interviews later, it’s hard to imagine how many moments like this exist in the archive.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s hard to measure the impact of those moments…on the people who recorded interviews…and also on the people who have helped build StoryCorps…,['Declarative Clause']
So we’re going to leave you with a conversation I recently had with Dave about just that…,['Declarative Clause']
"So, for this last episode, looking back on twenty years, so many people have contributed to making StoryCorps what it is now, of course",['Declarative Clause']
And we’ve all had life changes.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’ve gotten married, had children in this time.",['Declarative Clause']
Me too.,['Declarative Clause']
Right!,['Exclamatory Clause']
Lots of people have put their whole selves into this work.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, well, I mean I think that everybody when they leave StoryCorps to a person and, you know, we’ve had thousands of employees at this point over the years, you know, everyone says that the best thing about StoryCorps are the people.",['Declarative Clause']
"The StoryCorps team has never ceased to amaze me and, you know, that’s why we are what we are.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, true story and kind of crazy, but our first corporate sponsor was Hebrew National Hot Dogs.",['Declarative Clause']
I don’t know why.,['Declarative Clause']
I have absolutely no idea.,['Declarative Clause']
"But their, um, motto famously was, We answer to a higher authority and, you know, I think that’s how all of us have felt at StoryCorps over these past 20 years, that this is sacred work and it draws a very special person to do this work.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s very hard work.,['Declarative Clause']
There’s nothing viral or easy about StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, but it’s drawn people who just refuse to give up and I think that’s part of the secret sauce and the magic of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
One of the original StoryCorps employees–we started with four or five–and one of them was a guy named Matt Ozug.,['Declarative Clause']
And when he left he said at his goodbye party that “StoryCorps is hard work and love work and blood work.”,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, truer words have never been spoken.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, um, you know, it’s been worth every bit of it, and I’m incredibly grateful to the staff who helped make this dream come true.",['Declarative Clause']
"So what are your hopes for the future, for the next 20 years?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Some people have said to me over the years that, you know, if aliens came to earth and they could only find one thing, they hoped it would be the StoryCorps archive because it really, it shows the best in us, but it also shows who we really are and that is the best in us.",['Declarative Clause']
"Um, and I, you know, I hope that the ethos of StoryCorps, that the idea that all of our lives and all of our stories matter equally and infinitely, the idea that we should treat each other with respect, that nobody’s the worst thing they’ve they’ve ever done, that people should be given a second chance that it flows through the veins of the country and participating in StoryCorps and listening to StoryCorps stories becomes part of what it means to be an American and that StoryCorps grows into an institution that outlives us all.",['Declarative Clause']

"In 1931, a young Native Hawaiian man, Joseph Kahahawai, was wrongfully accused of sexually assaulting the wife of a U.S. Navy officer …",['Declarative Clause']
"Soon after, he was killed by her relatives.",['Declarative Clause']
Kim Farrant is his niece.,['Declarative Clause']
"But growing up, her family never spoke about her uncle.",['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps in Honolulu, she told her sister …  Joy Kahahawai-Welch … how she first heard the story.",['Declarative Clause']
I was in a Hawaiian history class in middle school and one of the topics was a very tragic story of a young man who was falsely accused of raping a woman and then the family kidnapped and murdered him.,['Declarative Clause']
And they were never brought to justice.,['Declarative Clause']
This man had the very same name as our dad: Joseph Kahahawai.,['Declarative Clause']
"The teacher then asked me, ‘Is this your family?’",['Declarative Clause']
"So I came home and I asked mom and she said, ‘Yeah. That is dad’s brother.’",['Declarative Clause']
He had just turned 23 years old right before he was killed.,['Declarative Clause']
And then our dad was born just 11 months later.,['Declarative Clause']
He inherited the very same name.,['Declarative Clause']
So Dad was the new Joe… and he became the star of our family.,['Declarative Clause']
He was like the sun that we all revolved around.,['Declarative Clause']
I think he knew that they wanted the name and the legacy to live on.,['Declarative Clause']
You know… Dad innately carried himself a certain way to make his brother proud.,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember wanting to hear more about what happened.,['Declarative Clause']
"But the gist of it was, ‘It’s just too hard to talk about.’",['Declarative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
"I look back and I think, ‘Oh, is there something to be ashamed of?’",['Declarative Clause']
But that first generation needed those years of silence and peace to heal and recover.,['Declarative Clause']
And it made us all hold each other more close and more dear … Like we’re this unbroken chain of family. ,['Declarative Clause']
"We pay our uncle our respects by going to the cemetery, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
Taking care of it.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s a humble cemetery in the middle of Kalihi.,['Declarative Clause']
And the plumeria tree above his grave has a lot of flowers.,['Declarative Clause']
So fresh flowers are raining down on him daily right now.,['Declarative Clause']
‘Ho’omana’o’ is on his gravestone and that’s a good reminder to never forget. Always remember.,['Declarative Clause']
"We had no idea, we really didn’t, so we were caught off guard, as you might say.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, Mom, the amount of stuff I was looking at online when I got the computer, that was just me trying to learn about what it meant to be gay.",['Declarative Clause']
"if y’all were Snoopy parents, it would have taken no time to figure it out.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember in that very first conversation, I was looking directly across from you, and you fell into your dad’s arms.",['Declarative Clause']
"I know that I was numb in a lot of ways because a big part of it was feeling separated from you, and I didn’t like that.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, I remember feeling that distance.",['Declarative Clause']
"I think that with where all of us were, it was inevitable.",['Declarative Clause']
"And during those months and a couple years there, you would come back, we would have more conversations.",['Declarative Clause']
"Of course a lot of it we may not have understood, but it didn’t leave us just reeling, we talked about those things.",['Declarative Clause']
As we were figuring out what this was going to look like for us.,['Declarative Clause']
"Sometimes I just go into your room, even though we’ve remodeled, we made sure not to touch that room, and I sit on your bed, and I am really so hopeful that it was a good space because I wanted you to be a happy kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"The truth is, I felt so loved as a kid, but, I mean, there’s a part of that journey that no one can join you on.",['Declarative Clause']
"A hard thing that I’ve always wanted to share with you, the beginning of my sophomore year, I was struggling the most.",['Declarative Clause']
"And it was this dark night of the soul where it’s like, can I really accept this?",['Interrogative Clause']
Have I failed at life?,['Interrogative Clause']
"And there was that one night that got really hard, and I remember sitting on the windowsill and just contemplating it, like, what would it be like for this to all be over?",['Interrogative Clause']
"And this feeling that I had is you, and it’s like this invisible golden lasso.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I knew that even in this worst moment of my life, that I can’t fall.",['Declarative Clause']
And the work that I do with these kids is how I took that golden lasso and I turned it into a net.,['Declarative Clause']
And we just keep saving people with that love that you put in me.,['Declarative Clause']
Sometimes I look at you and I just can’t fathom the kind of love that I see you give it’s a humbling experience.,['Declarative Clause']
"You came into my life and changed me in so many ways, I’m so much better now than I ever would have been without you…and I’m so grateful to be your mom.",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s Corey Harvard and his mom Lisa Harvard in Mobile, Alabama.  In 2018, Corey co-founded Prism United, which provides support groups and access to therapy for LGBTQ+ youth and their families in Southwest Alabama.",['Declarative Clause']
"When Robert Robinson’s daughter, Angel, started rapidly losing weight… doctors incorrectly diagnosed them with an eating disorder.",['Declarative Clause']
But on one visit to the hospital… a doctor on-call discovered a rare stomach tumor.,['Declarative Clause']
"That doctor, John Fortunato, would stay with the family through Angel’s treatment up until their death in 2023.",['Declarative Clause']
"At StoryCorps in Chicago, Dr. Fortunato sat down with Angel’s father for this conversation.",['Declarative Clause']
My first memory of meeting Angel was in the hospital.,['Interrogative Clause']
A teenager who was… in control of the room.,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember she told me to push her on her belly and I could make her throw up.,['Declarative Clause']
"After I diagnosed Angel with the tumor, what was your first response to that?",['Declarative Clause']
"Before you discovered it, no one would listen to her.",['Declarative Clause']
Even me.,['Declarative Clause']
And… I still regret that.,['Declarative Clause']
But I didn’t know.,['Declarative Clause']
They were saying it was an eating disorder.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, when you go to the doctor, you’re trusting the professionals.",['Declarative Clause']
"You just, ‘Okay, that’s what the doctor said, that’s what it is.’",['Declarative Clause']
"So I’m kind of trying to push her, you know what I mean?",['Interrogative Clause']
And it’s not her fault.,['Declarative Clause']
"Parents, myself included, don’t always see things clearly, especially as it relates to teenagers.",['Declarative Clause']
But that doesn’t mean a parent’s doing something wrong.,['Declarative Clause']
I never tell someone not to feel guilty because that’s not a fair expectation.,['Declarative Clause']
"But, we just do the best we can to support and love our kids.",['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s something that amazed me… you being a single father of twins, and somehow spending an incredible amount of time and energy with both your daughters.",['Declarative Clause']
Nothing else mattered to me but my kids.,['Declarative Clause']
We couldn’t rely on anybody but each other.,['Declarative Clause']
"It was us against the world type of situation that I feel made her stronger, mentally.",['Declarative Clause']
"Cause it’s lot of times I wanted to be like… ‘Well, if you’re gonna die anyway, forget doing this chemo. You can keep your hair.’",['Declarative Clause']
"And she would, ‘Nah, we don’t give up. I’m gonna keep fighting.’",['Declarative Clause']
Sometimes you sink or swim and I got the impression that Angel was not gonna sink under any circumstances.,['Declarative Clause']
"No, she wasn’t.",['Declarative Clause']
I wasn’t ready to give up either.,['Declarative Clause']
"But I realized, you know, after a while… it was a, just, almost impossible situation.",['Declarative Clause']
"When Angel died, I just remember, standing over her trying to talk to her and her eyes was open but she wasn’t responsive.",['Declarative Clause']
And her sister was singing to her.,['Declarative Clause']
"And her heart rate was dropping, it was going from 180, it went down to 140.",['Declarative Clause']
From 140 it went down to 80.,['Declarative Clause']
From 80 it went down to 40 and… it was over.,['Declarative Clause']
" I wish that none of this had ever happened to your family but she, um, reminded me kinda what I got into this career to begin with for… and that’s the only regret is I wish I could have told her what her impact was.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I really appreciate those times, everyone was saying ‘It’s a wrap,’ you know what I mean?",['Interrogative Clause']
"For you to still be there and be like, ‘Nah, there’s still stuff you can do, you ain’t gotta blow the trumpet just yet.’",['Declarative Clause']
"When a time when there wasn’t any hope, that really lifted us up.",['Declarative Clause']
"When I walked in the room, Angel was smiling the whole time.",['Declarative Clause']
" If this was to be your very last conversation, is there anything you want to say to me?",['Interrogative Clause']
"It was good while it lasted, but I must go.",['Declarative Clause']
You act like it’s the ending of a relationship,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, yeah, I guess it is… but–",['Declarative Clause']
"Oh… Well, what about you?",['Interrogative Clause']
What would you do?,['Interrogative Clause']
If this was my last conversation?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I would tell you the same thing, that I love you.",['Declarative Clause']
Do you want to be cremated?,['Interrogative Clause']
And where you want us to throw you?,['Interrogative Clause']
"In the toilet, the garbage can?",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, not the garbage can.",['Declarative Clause']
"All that, it didn’t make no sense to get me cremated",['Declarative Clause']
"Okay, so sorry.",['Declarative Clause']
Just get me cremated and throw me out back?,['Interrogative Clause']
"We could use some soil and, you know, plant a tree.",['Declarative Clause']
Oh yeah… That would be awesome.,['Declarative Clause']
Uuuhuu.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"Something that can give fruit, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
That can give back.,['Declarative Clause']
" Yes, give it back.",['Declarative Clause']
"So for your great great grandchild listening to this years from now, is there any wisdom you want to pass on to them?",['Interrogative Clause']
"You know, you don’t have to be religious to believe in something, ‘cause religion is what you do every day.",['Declarative Clause']
"And they got a song that say, ‘You don’t miss your water ‘til your well run dry.’",['Declarative Clause']
That’s why you’re supposed to treat people kind while they’re alive.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when your well dry, you want to see that person again.",['Declarative Clause']
But it’s all over.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, we made do girl…",['Declarative Clause']
"Eventually, I’ve gotta go.",['Declarative Clause']
And I know it’s gonna break your heart.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ll be sad that I’m gone ‘cause I won’t have you to talk to.,['Declarative Clause']
But it’s gonna be alright.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’mma always be with you, here.",['Declarative Clause']
I looked different than everybody else.,['Declarative Clause']
"There was either white people or Black people, and there was me.",['Declarative Clause']
"And so, I stood out.",['Declarative Clause']
"And the cops would stop me sometimes, even as a young kid, they would stop me and go, ‘You know, you don’t belong in this neighborhood.’",['Declarative Clause']
"I was living in Rhode Island and Rhode Island School of Design had a, like, summer scholarships.",['Declarative Clause']
"So I entered the competition and the art teacher said, ‘They don’t want people like you.’",['Declarative Clause']
"And uh, I stopped drawing ever since then.",['Declarative Clause']
Wow.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"It, it, it hurt.",['Declarative Clause']
How old were you?,['Interrogative Clause']
I might’ve been 13.,['Declarative Clause']
Hmm.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"And, uh, people would say, like, ‘You know, you’re gonna end up in jail,’ or, ‘You’re not gonna ever become anything’ or anything like that.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I was, ‘I’m gonna prove them wrong. I need to go somewhere. I need more than this.’",['Declarative Clause']
And I went to New York.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I slept in hallways, and I slept in the subways, and I slept in Grand Central Station.",['Declarative Clause']
"I really couldn’t read and write very well, and, uh, when I did have jobs, I usually weren’t able to keep those jobs.",['Declarative Clause']
And then I learned to read and write by forcing myself to read an encyclopedia.,['Declarative Clause']
And I applied to go to an art school.,['Declarative Clause']
"I would like to hear more about how you built the confidence to pursue an artistic career, which I see as quite risky.",['Imperative Clause']
"It was a little scary, but because Mommy did so much supporting us, it wasn’t as scary as if I was the only breadwinner.",['Declarative Clause']
And my joke was always that I did all the cooking and the sewing.,['Declarative Clause']
And Mommy did the brickwork and the plumbing.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when you girls were growing up, I made it a point that we would always have family meals on the weekend.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I wanted to raise my girls as really strong, powerful women.",['Declarative Clause']
"You girls would say, ‘I didn’t like when you raised your voice.’",['Declarative Clause']
And then I would learn to not be so tough on you.,['Declarative Clause']
"But you’re navigating the world very well, all of you.",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m 38, the age that you were when you had me.",['Declarative Clause']
What advice do you have for me?,['Interrogative Clause']
The sad thing about human beings is that we tend to remember the unhappy things.,['Declarative Clause']
And I think my advice to you is just try to be happy.,['Declarative Clause']
The longest life is short.,['Declarative Clause']
"I would always say, ‘What can I do? As a parent, to make your life better?’",['Declarative Clause']
"Miranda Duschack and Mimo Davis’ have been farming together since 2012, supplying flowers in the St. Louis area.",['Declarative Clause']
At StoryCorps Miranda and Mimo told their own love story as the first lesbian couple married in Missouri.,['Declarative Clause']
We met at work.,['Declarative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
At our day job.,['Declarative Clause']
"And then we decided to farm together…fell in love, got married, at a spiritual ceremony where we jumped the broom because we couldn’t legally be married.",['Declarative Clause']
And then the second wedding was in 2014 to be legally married.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember this?,['Interrogative Clause']
When we had August.,['Declarative Clause']
"Do you remember how I pushed August out, ok…",['Interrogative Clause']
"What do you mean, do I remember that?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
But they didn’t know how to fill out the birth certificate.,['Declarative Clause']
I do remember that.,['Declarative Clause']
"So, I was making a fact sheet to leave at the nurse’s station about how to register.",['Declarative Clause']
Um…,['Exclamatory Clause']
It’s okay.,['Declarative Clause']
"I just felt like we were total freaks, man.",['Declarative Clause']
"We weren’t freaks, we were just firsts.",['Declarative Clause']
We were just first.,['Declarative Clause']
And it was really embarrassing for me that we fought so hard to get married and then we got divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
"But, you know, that was part of the rights that we fought for.",['Declarative Clause']
I know.,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, I would say that to people, You know, it…",['Declarative Clause']
"And that’s all part of the package, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
You get to be married and then you get to be divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
I mean…,['Declarative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
"I was like, just like straight people.",['Declarative Clause']
Just like straight people,['Declarative Clause']
Right.,['Declarative Clause']
I can get divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
I can get divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
It didn’t necessarily pan out the way we thought it would be…,['Declarative Clause']
But we’re still in it.,['Declarative Clause']
We’re still farming partners.,['Declarative Clause']
We’re raising a beautiful son.,['Declarative Clause']
These are gorgeous flowers sitting in front of us.,['Declarative Clause']
"And Mimo Davis, I’m going to say right now, I still really love you and care about you.",['Declarative Clause']
"Of course, of course, I love you and care about you too.",['Declarative Clause']
I mean that was never in question for me.,['Declarative Clause']
"We are both really, in our hearts and souls and deep down, totally committed to each other, and that’s why we work through all the real stuff.",['Declarative Clause']
And I see that as a win.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s okay.,['Declarative Clause']
You can have you some tears.,['Declarative Clause']
"You and I would stay up till 12 o’clock at night, waiting to make that phone call to Pakistan, reminding them that we were inquiring about a child.",['Declarative Clause']
"And they would always say, ‘There’s no child for you.’",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I’ve wanted to be a father since I was a little kid.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I think hearing those words night after night, it was sad.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, the moment they said, ‘We have a baby for you,’ I just remember this feeling of joy.",['Declarative Clause']
Seeing her for the first time and holding her was just the most gorgeous moment of my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"So, do you remember the day when you got your full diagnosis?",['Interrogative Clause']
"They called and they said, ‘You probably have a year to live.’",['Declarative Clause']
But It didn’t feel like all bad news.,['Declarative Clause']
"Like, think about the 40 years that God has given me.",['Declarative Clause']
What a beautiful life.,['Exclamatory Clause']
What a purposeful life.,['Exclamatory Clause']
What a blessed life.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"But, Radiyya is always asking, ‘Are you better now?’",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I say, ‘Abba is not going to get better.’",['Declarative Clause']
"And when she says, ‘But then I’ll cry and I’ll cry.’",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember saying to her, ‘Aap insaan ho. Ronaa theek hay.’",['Declarative Clause']
"You’re a human being, so it’s okay to cry, to be sad.",['Declarative Clause']
And you’ve told me that one of the hardest things you imagine is explaining to her where I am.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, When she wakes up in the morning and she looks over to our bed and says, ‘Where’s Abba?’",['Declarative Clause']
And you’re in the bathroom.,['Declarative Clause']
I can’t but think about that moment when I’m going to have to answer that differently.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s going to be a hard one for me.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, I feel a lot of sorrow in my heart thinking about that moment.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, even though I won’t be there physically, just know that I’ll be there spiritually.",['Declarative Clause']
You won’t be alone.,['Declarative Clause']
"So many people have said, ‘We’re praying for a miracle.’",['Declarative Clause']
But I always chuckle at that because I feel like my entire life has been a miracle.,['Declarative Clause']
And one of them is finding you.,['Declarative Clause']
"What you’ve done for me, waking up in the middle of the night, almost every night for the past three months, because I’m in pain.",['Declarative Clause']
"Those are the things that I hope Radiyya really knows, that that’s how you took care of me.",['Declarative Clause']
You know I’m just grateful for each moment that we get.,['Declarative Clause']
"My hope is that Radiyya will live life beautifully, no matter how long God gives her.",['Declarative Clause']
And you are especially going to teach her what it means to take life as a gift and to live it out every day.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember the first time you put on the uniform?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I just felt like, oh, I’m a proud Marine, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
I thought I was something.,['Declarative Clause']
"I wanted to help fight for our country, and also show that we had the courage and intelligence to do so.",['Declarative Clause']
We knew we were the best.,['Declarative Clause']
Well we made it our business to be the best of the best.,['Declarative Clause']
Not mediocre but the best.,['Declarative Clause']
We’re going to hear now from Corporal Sidney Allen Francis.,['Declarative Clause']
"After serving as one of the first Black Marines… he worked as a New York City police detective… and in 2005 spoke with his daughter, Candice, at StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
"I wanted to go into the Army, but they said no.",['Declarative Clause']
And this was World War II?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
"And they stamped my papers ‘Navy,’ and there was no way in the Hell I was going to the Navy.",['Declarative Clause']
Why didn’t you want to go in the Navy?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I didn’t like the little hats they were in, the little …",['Declarative Clause']
"So then I said, ‘What about the Marine Corps?’",['Declarative Clause']
"The guy says, ‘Well, you have to go ‘round and see the Sergeant Major.’",['Declarative Clause']
First thing he said to me: ‘Are you a high school graduate?’,['Declarative Clause']
"I said, ‘Yes, sir.’ And I went to North Carolina for boot camp.",['Declarative Clause']
And what was that like?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I mean, they were rough.",['Declarative Clause']
"Now, were your drill instructors, were they white or Black?",['Interrogative Clause']
"No, they were Black.",['Declarative Clause']
"But see, they had trained under white instructors because up to 1942, the Marine Corps had no Blacks.",['Declarative Clause']
And that’s why they were extra tough on us.,['Declarative Clause']
They wanted us to make it.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, we did.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, I have to tell you, I once went to jail down there.",['Declarative Clause']
"I was with my buddy from New York, he was in the Marine Corps, and we were going to Raleigh from Montford Point.",['Declarative Clause']
And we’re sitting in the back of the bus.,['Declarative Clause']
"Then the bus stopped to pick up people, and the bus driver came up and he said, uh, ‘You guys will have to get up.’",['Declarative Clause']
"I said, ‘Get up for what?’",['Declarative Clause']
"He says, ‘These white people have to sit down.’",['Declarative Clause']
"I said, ‘We’re in the back of the bus.’",['Declarative Clause']
"He said, ‘You ought to get up.’",['Declarative Clause']
And I lost my head then.,['Declarative Clause']
"I says, ‘We’re not getting up.’",['Declarative Clause']
"And lo and behold, in not even 10 minutes, in comes police with guns drawn.",['Declarative Clause']
And they took me that night to some little prison camp.,['Declarative Clause']
"And in the morning I heard, ‘Warden, this is Major Pauper, United States Marine Corps. You got one of my boys in there.’",['Declarative Clause']
"All the Marines from Montford Point, they were on six by six trucks with machine guns at the ready.",['Declarative Clause']
You could see they just wanted to tear that jail down.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when I came out, Major Pauper, he says, ‘PFC Francis, you get on that truck. We’re out of here.’",['Declarative Clause']
"And he hollered it back, ‘Thank you, Warden, that you didn’t hurt one of my Marines.’",['Declarative Clause']
"He said, ‘You would have been in trouble.’",['Declarative Clause']
"That was Sidney Allen Francis speaking with his daughter, Candice.",['Declarative Clause']
"Sidney died February 15, 2014.",['Declarative Clause']
His daughter recently came back to StoryCorps,['Declarative Clause']
So I didn’t know that story before.,['Declarative Clause']
"He had never shared that with me, but it sounded like my father.",['Declarative Clause']
I wasn’t surprised by that at all.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, a lot of Black men who served this country had to also suffer indignities, even while in uniform.",['Declarative Clause']
I don’t think that they’ve gotten the credit that they deserve for putting their lives in danger.,['Declarative Clause']
"And coming out of it with scars that didn’t come from the so-called enemy, but came from within.",['Declarative Clause']
But what I appreciate about my father is that he used his military service to give him what he needed to build a life for himself and his family.,['Declarative Clause']
"It gave him purpose, and it gave him an anchor …",['Declarative Clause']
And I’m grateful for that.,['Declarative Clause']
So what do you want your grandchildren to know about you?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I want them to just remember that I loved them, that’s all.",['Declarative Clause']
There’s nothing exciting about me.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m just a man.,['Declarative Clause']
Jackie Miller and her son Scott first came to StoryCorps in 2008… when Jackie revealed a secret…,['Declarative Clause']
"When I was seventeen, I got pregnant.",['Declarative Clause']
And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.,['Declarative Clause']
Wow.,['Exclamatory Clause']
I just wasn’t ready for that.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m sure.,['Declarative Clause']
I worry that you’ll never know how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s something I can’t make better for you.,['Declarative Clause']
And I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but… you’ll be okay…,['Declarative Clause']
They came back in 2023.,['Declarative Clause']
"At 88, Jackie’s health was declining…",['Declarative Clause']
Realizing his mom was nearing the end of life…,['Declarative Clause']
Scott wanted to do one more interview…,['Declarative Clause']
I cannot believe 15 years have passed.,['Declarative Clause']
I don’t have any more revelations to unleash on you.,['Declarative Clause']
And now I have an old person’s voice.,['Declarative Clause']
It cracks…,['Declarative Clause']
But I still don’t think of myself as old.,['Declarative Clause']
"I mean, when I find myself — oh gosh — flirting I realize a guy would have to be nuts to flirt back.",['Declarative Clause']
But that doesn’t keep me from doing it.,['Declarative Clause']
"The last time, the guy was giving me my flu shot.",['Declarative Clause']
"He was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.",['Declarative Clause']
But my world is really getting smaller.,['Declarative Clause']
Words don’t come that easily to me now.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s really scary.,['Declarative Clause']
"The other day, I couldn’t remember my cell phone number.",['Declarative Clause']
"I recognize this is part of getting not older but old, you know?",['Interrogative Clause']
" Yeah… You know in our first interview I had said, uh… it scares me imagining life without you, and it doesn’t so much scare me anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
"But, it makes me uneasy imagining a world without you in it.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, when your parents are both gone, you’re kind of nobody’s son.",['Declarative Clause']
So when I think about what I’m going to be holding onto when you’re gone…,['Declarative Clause']
"It feels so simple, but our conversations… and your voice.",['Declarative Clause']
"One of the things every parent wants to know is just, how happy are you with your life?",['Interrogative Clause']
I’m very happy about my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"I just would like to emphasize — and I want you to hear — how you gave my life, give my life, such meaning.",['Declarative Clause']
I will miss having a friend who is unconditionally in love with you…,['Declarative Clause']
There’s no other relationship that’s the same as that.,['Declarative Clause']
"You can have great friends or loved ones, but it’s not the same.",['Declarative Clause']
As you’ve heard… StoryCorps has always been about chasing big ideas.,['Declarative Clause']
And one of those big ideas is that every single person in the country would one day be able to record an interview.,['Declarative Clause']
"But during our first ten years, if someone wanted to record, they’d have to come to one of our booths in person.",['Declarative Clause']
"In 2015, that all changed…",['Declarative Clause']
"That year, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay went on stage to give a TED Talk.",['Declarative Clause']
"Tonight, I’m going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person’s life, and in yours…",['Declarative Clause']
Dave had won the TED Prize….,['Declarative Clause']
And that night he was on stage to reveal a brand new idea.,['Declarative Clause']
"Here is my wish: that you will help us take everything we’ve learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world, so that anyone can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history.",['Declarative Clause']
"Over the past couple of months, the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths, so that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime.",['Declarative Clause']
"Together we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity, and maybe in doing so, we’ll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less.",['Declarative Clause']
Maybe these conversations will remind us what is really important.,['Declarative Clause']
"And maybe, just maybe, it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life, every single life, matters equally and infinitely.",['Declarative Clause']
Thank you very much.,['Declarative Clause']
"And just like that, one of the largest barriers to participating in StoryCorps was gone.",['Declarative Clause']
"Grandpa, tell me about your parents…",['Imperative Clause']
What was your first impression when you came to America?,['Exclamatory Clause']
Can you share one of the happiest memories in your lifetime?,['Interrogative Clause']
Tell me what you were like as a child and how did you like to spend your time…,['Imperative Clause']
"My advice is don’t grow up, it’s a trap!",['Declarative Clause']
In this episode… stories from beyond the recording booth…,['Declarative Clause']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Declarative Clause']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
"A few months after the app came out, there was a perfect opportunity to get people to use it… Thanksgiving – a holiday known for putting family members in the same room.",['Declarative Clause']
So that year… we asked people to use the app when they went home for the holidays.,['Declarative Clause']
We called it the Great Thanksgiving Listen… and it’s actually become a once-a-year tradition.,['Declarative Clause']
"The hope was that we could get enough people to interview each other… that we’d document an entire generation in one day… like we said, big ideas.",['Declarative Clause']
"Anyway, the interviews started coming in… from people’s kitchens, hotel rooms… and even one from inside a parked car at a strip mall in Iowa…",['Declarative Clause']
We asked that person who recorded that one  to walk us through that experience…,['Declarative Clause']
Hi my name is Kara Masteller and I interviewed my grandfather in my 1994 Buick.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, she was a good looker.",['Declarative Clause']
We fit together.,['Declarative Clause']
We were a good pair.,['Declarative Clause']
"My grandma, everyone referred to her as like a spicy meatball.",['Declarative Clause']
"She swore a lot, but she looked so innocent that no one ever expected her to say the things that she said.",['Declarative Clause']
Were you nervous to propose to her?,['Interrogative Clause']
"We had something to say, we said it.",['Declarative Clause']
What are the keys to a happy marriage?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Well if something happens just say, ‘I’m sorry’ and get it over with.",['Declarative Clause']
There’s no reason to carry on.,['Declarative Clause']
"I just say ‘I’m sorry. I love ya,’ and that was the whole story.",['Declarative Clause']
I was really surprised by my grandpa saying sorry.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve never heard him say sorry.,['Declarative Clause']
How would you like to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
Remem—?,['Interrogative Clause']
Do you want to be remembered as like a real tough guy?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I was a pretty soft guy.",['Declarative Clause']
You intimidated me when I was little.,['Declarative Clause']
I did?,['Interrogative Clause']
You did.,['Declarative Clause']
Are you happy about the life you’ve lived?,['Interrogative Clause']
It wasn’t the easiest life back in them days.,['Declarative Clause']
Mother died when I was four.,['Declarative Clause']
And it was a tough life.,['Declarative Clause']
He tells one story about how he was eight or nine and he was ice skating on the river and he fell through.,['Declarative Clause']
He didn’t have hot water wherever he was living with his dad.,['Declarative Clause']
So he broke into the school and just took a hot shower in the school.,['Declarative Clause']
I think that says a lot about his childhood that there was really no one there to help him get out of the water or keep him warm.,['Declarative Clause']
"Last April he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and I had never really heard him say much about it.",['Declarative Clause']
What do you think about Alzheimer’s?,['Interrogative Clause']
Not much you can do.,['Declarative Clause']
I even can’t remember some names now myself.,['Declarative Clause']
So maybe I have got it.,['Declarative Clause']
"And when he said, ‘I don’t know what it would be like to have it.’",['Declarative Clause']
That was difficult for me.,['Declarative Clause']
"So then I had to ask a follow-up just out of, I don’t know, self-preservation because I thought I was gonna cry.",['Declarative Clause']
"As people age, do you have any advice for them as they get older?",['Interrogative Clause']
It’s coming.,['Declarative Clause']
Don’t fight it.,['Imperative Clause']
Just roll with.,['Imperative Clause']
I mean real life.,['Declarative Clause']
Live it.,['Imperative Clause']
It’s wonderful.,['Declarative Clause']
After the interview my grandpa and I talked a lot more.,['Declarative Clause']
"The last thing he said \n(laughs) before we got out of the car was, ‘Let’s give ‘em hell kiddo.’",['Declarative Clause']
That’s Kara Masteller with her grandfather James Kennicott from her 1994 Buick in an Iowa parking lot…,['Declarative Clause']
"Before this… StoryCorps typically had been recording about 7,000 interviews a year.",['Declarative Clause']
"But with the app… on the Sunday after Thanksgiving… 17,000 interviews were added to the archive.",['Declarative Clause']
The app made it possible for people to record even if their hometown wasn’t a stop on the StoryCorps tour… which is important… because some conversations can’t wait. Dave Isay knew that first hand… ,['Declarative Clause']
"Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago, when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health, was diagnosed with cancer.",['Declarative Clause']
He passed away very suddenly a few days later.,['Declarative Clause']
I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died.,['Declarative Clause']
"I have a couple of young kids at home, and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session.",['Declarative Clause']
"I thought I couldn’t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did, but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.",['Declarative Clause']
"Every day, people come up to me and say, ”I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother, but I waited too long.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Now, no one has to wait anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
"And we saw people using the app in this way, like Eva Vega-Olds…",['Declarative Clause']
"In 2015, her father Leonardo was diagnosed with lung cancer.",['Declarative Clause']
After going through chemo unsuccessfully… he went into hospice care at his home in New Jersey.,['Declarative Clause']
And Eva used the app to preserve his voice…,['Declarative Clause']
"When I was recording my dad, I was in his bedroom that he shared with my mom.",['Declarative Clause']
"There was the hospital bed in there, he had an oxygen machine, and he was struggling to breath, but I said, “Dad, do you want to do an interview?”",['Declarative Clause']
"Daddy, where were you born?",['Interrogative Clause']
Puerto Rico.,['Declarative Clause']
And do you know how long you’ve been in New Jersey?,['Interrogative Clause']
Sixty-five years.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve been here all my life.,['Declarative Clause']
"He was a factory worker, worked the graveyard shift, you know so he’s leaving for work when we’re coming back from school.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then later on, he was a custodian and he was always working.",['Declarative Clause']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
I don’t know…,['Declarative Clause']
"Well I plan on telling the kids that you were really loyal, a committed father… funny…",['Declarative Clause']
"My family’s the kind of family that if you can’t take sarcasm, forget about it.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like my wedding day, I remember walking down the aisle, and my dad was walking like super slow.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I’m like, “Dad!”",['Declarative Clause']
"And he says to me, “Shhh, it’s my day. I finally get rid of you.”",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember teaching me how to swim?,['Interrogative Clause']
Mm-hmm…,['Exclamatory Clause']
I remember you throwing me in the water and I was screaming and crying like I was gonna drown.,['Declarative Clause']
"And I was like, “No, I can’t swim!” And then you yelled at me, “Well then just stand up”",['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember that?,['Interrogative Clause']
"When we took him home, he came back to hospice care and the nurses were there.",['Declarative Clause']
"He looked at me and he said, “I think they think I’m gonna die.”",['Declarative Clause']
"And I said, “Well, if you feel differently then do differently.”",['Declarative Clause']
But every day he got weaker and closer to the end.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you think you’re dying?,['Interrogative Clause']
Everybody dies.,['Declarative Clause']
"Up until that moment, we had not talked about him dying.",['Declarative Clause']
Are you afraid?,['Interrogative Clause']
I wish it wasn’t happening right now.,['Declarative Clause']
What are you most proud of Daddy?,['Interrogative Clause']
My kids.,['Declarative Clause']
Your kids?,['Interrogative Clause']
My family.,['Declarative Clause']
"Okay, let me end it for now…",['Declarative Clause']
I did the interview Tuesday afternoon and he passed on Thursday night.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, not for nothing but my dad’s a working class fellow, he bought a home, paid off his home, and was able to die in his home, with his family around him.",['Declarative Clause']
"For him, that was the pinnacle of what your life should be. And I think that he did achieve his dreams.",['Declarative Clause']
Coming up after the break…,['Declarative Clause']
"StoryCorps’ whole business model, if you will, is getting two people together in an enclosed space to talk right at each other, which, you know, when there’s a global respiratory pandemic is, you know, not great.",['Declarative Clause']
Stay with us…,['Imperative Clause']
When the entire world came to a halt in March of 2020… so did StoryCorps…,['Declarative Clause']
"We all were kind of like, what the heck do we do?",['Interrogative Clause']
"That’s Martin Olson, the director of digital at StoryCorps – he’s the guy behind the scenes who keeps things like our app and the archive running.",['Declarative Clause']
And in the early days of Covid… when suddenly no one could sit down together for an interview anymore… he had to kind of figure out how to keep StoryCorps itself running.,['Declarative Clause']
"I remember we were still at the StoryCorps offices and Dave just came by and, sort of, started chatting.",['Declarative Clause']
"He was just like, “Can we do anything remote?”",['Declarative Clause']
"And, you know, obviously looking a little bit panicked.",['Declarative Clause']
"Like, How can we actually do something that helps bring people together in this crazy moment?",['Interrogative Clause']
"I had actually been messing around a little bit with remote recording, and, at that point, Zoom had entered people’s lives very quickly.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, here we come, a non-profit with a two person digital team and we’re like, “Cool, we’re going to build a thing. Trust us, it’ll work.”",['Declarative Clause']
And just like that…another “big idea” was born…,['Declarative Clause']
And I remember over a weekend basically sat down and banged together like a little basic prototype.,['Declarative Clause']
Two people with browsers can see each other; they can talk to each other.,['Declarative Clause']
We can record this audio and then we can get that to talk to our archive.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, that weekend where you sat down to just be like, I gotta build this thing?",['Interrogative Clause']
"I mean, are you hunched over your computer til three in the morning, like, how are you doing this?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I guess coffee is an occupational hazard of being both a computer nerd and Swedish–actually my son’s first word was kaffe, which is, uh, coffee in Swedish.",['Declarative Clause']
"So thankfully that kept me going, but honestly it was a little bit sort of piece by piece, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
"It’s like, alright well, Okay so I’ve got one window and I can see myself in that one and I can see myself in this one.",['Declarative Clause']
"Okay, so they need to hit a record button.",['Declarative Clause']
Alright so we’ll add that,['Declarative Clause']
Did it work?,['Interrogative Clause']
Crap it didn’t work.,['Declarative Clause']
"Alright, doop, doop, doop…Try a thing.",['Declarative Clause']
You realize that you forgot a semicolon somewhere because it’s two in the morning.,['Declarative Clause']
"It’s a little bit of just sort of trying your way forward sometimes, until you sort of look up and you’re like oh, I should probably go to bed or I’m gonna be a little groggy tomorrow. ",['Declarative Clause']
"So was all of this exciting for you as, like, a nerdy tech guy?",['Interrogative Clause']
Or was it terrifying?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Yeah, I resent the premise of the question as a nerdy tech guy, but…",['Declarative Clause']
"Hey, I’m using your words.",['Declarative Clause']
As a highly socially competent tech guy.,['Declarative Clause']
"I don’t remember a moment where I kinda walked in and it was like, you know, Shark Tank and I was like, “Dave, here’s my prototype.”",['Declarative Clause']
"I think it was more like, “look I put this thing together; it seems like this is a thing we can do.”",['Declarative Clause']
Next thing I know it’s got a name called StoryCorps Connect.,['Declarative Clause']
"They’re like, “When can we get this thing done?”",['Declarative Clause']
You’ve got 48 hours…,['Declarative Clause']
Well no…yeah right.,['Declarative Clause']
It was a lot faster than you’d really wanna do this kind of thing.,['Declarative Clause']
But it was not like a single ‘just me’ effort. ,['Declarative Clause']
There was a lot of different people involved.,['Declarative Clause']
"At the time I also worked with another great guy named Steven on our technology team, so a lot of the early interviews are he and I testing internally.",['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, so this is a recording from my phone.",['Declarative Clause']
And I guess the real question is how is this going to come out on the other side.,['Declarative Clause']
Will it come out at all?,['Interrogative Clause']
Let’s see what happens.,['Declarative Clause']
We’ve gotta see if this thing records so I’ve gotta sit there and just record myself I guess.,['Declarative Clause']
"And so there’s a lot of me just like doo doo doo doo doo, you know,  into the thing and like…",['Declarative Clause']
"Before we released it more widely, we actually have a whole raft of interviews that were staff members calling family members.",['Declarative Clause']
And this includes you…,['Declarative Clause']
So I’ve got one with my sister.,['Declarative Clause']
"So hey, how’s it going?",['Interrogative Clause']
"It’s going alright, how are you?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Ah you know, stressing out.",['Declarative Clause']
"Because this thing tomorrow, in theory, this thing is going to go live and I basically built it in two weeks",['Declarative Clause']
Are we testing it?,['Interrogative Clause']
After lots of testing and fixing StoryCorps Connect on the fly… we opened it up to the public…and… people started to use it.,['Declarative Clause']
When did you realize COVID-19 was serious?,['Interrogative Clause']
My anxiety levels are always on 10.,['Declarative Clause']
"I pray on my way to work, I pray on my lunch break.",['Declarative Clause']
What keeps me going is the fact that I need to keep goin.,['Declarative Clause']
I fear whenever I leave the house.,['Declarative Clause']
"Everyday I wake up and just wonder, ’Is this the day that COVID-19 is gonna come home with me?’",['Interrogative Clause']
"I’ve lost several people over these last couple months that I wasn’t able to say goodbye to, and so that has been really hard.",['Declarative Clause']
One of the things I miss most is giving you a hug.,['Declarative Clause']
"And uh, when this is all over it’s, uh, one of the things I wanna do.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember we had this feeling like, you know, this is this important moment, not only do we need to be here to, you know, help people connect, but also, you know, to document this moment when all of a sudden people found themselves in this new alien world, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
"This new world was scary, unknown, and lonely…because the only thing worse than not seeing loved ones… was the possibility of exposing them to the virus…",['Declarative Clause']
"Dr. Roberto Vargas was the Director of Microbiology at a hospital in Rochester, New York.",['Declarative Clause']
When the pandemic hit he found himself working long hours in the lab… running countless COVID tests.,['Declarative Clause']
Because of the risk… and for the sake of his wife and four kids… he started living in a hotel near his lab… and then later in the basement of their house.,['Declarative Clause']
"That’s where he was for this StoryCorps Connect recording… with his wife, Susan, and their 10-year-old son, Xavier, directly upstairs from him… but speaking through their computers.",['Declarative Clause']
"When I would go to the hotel room after a long day and it was just me there, and it was very quiet; that was when I missed you all the most.",['Declarative Clause']
"It got very worrying once I knew the virus was going to be, like, a big thing, and with you gone it was way harder.",['Declarative Clause']
I just missed you.,['Declarative Clause']
"I remember you’d dropped groceries off and put them on the front porch, and that’s when we started talking through the window next to our front door.",['Declarative Clause']
"You would talk on your cell phone, and the kids and I would sit behind the window.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I remember one of the hardest nights, I think you were just exhausted, you just had your head on the window and were crying.",['Declarative Clause']
"But eventually, you started sleeping in the basement.",['Declarative Clause']
And I would not let the kids go past the top of the basement stairs.,['Declarative Clause']
"We had to stay far away but I just felt better that you could be, like, a part of us.",['Declarative Clause']
"It’s still very hard but it’s just nice to see you, Dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"You have been so helpful to mom, so thank you, ok? ",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember, once you came into the basement, the best night I had yet, you know, your coworker had made all these different dishes for us.",['Declarative Clause']
"You sat at the bottom of the stairs in a rocking chair, and I was at the top.",['Declarative Clause']
"I remember that, yes.",['Declarative Clause']
 I even remember the food; it smelled so good.,['Declarative Clause']
"It was the first time we had been able to connect in so long and, as crazy as it sounds, it’s the best date I’ve ever had with you in my life. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to do what I’ve been able to do at work.",['Declarative Clause']
You have to be absolutely everything to our four beautiful kids.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve never loved you more and I know it hasn’t been easy.,['Declarative Clause']
"Can you guys try not to cry, it makes me sad when you cry.",['Imperative Clause']
These are tears of happiness.,['Declarative Clause']
"Roberto, I admire you so much–always admired you–but you’ve done things these \npast couple months that seem impossible.",['Declarative Clause']
"What you’re doing is a lot harder than what I’m doing, a lot harder.",['Declarative Clause']
"Dad, I just want to say thank you for helping get rid of this virus.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s a team effort and that team includes you.,['Declarative Clause']
But what carries me through is this family.,['Declarative Clause']
"StoryCorps was always really about people talking to each other and looking back, sort of saying, like, where did you grow up?",['Interrogative Clause']
How did you get to this place?,['Interrogative Clause']
"During that time though we actually have so much of people just connecting with each other and saying, like, so how has this been for you?",['Interrogative Clause']
How is this currently going?,['Interrogative Clause']
"These basic realities of, like, figuring out how to be around each other, how to find toilet paper, you know, which, remember that? ",['Interrogative Clause']
God yeah.,['Exclamatory Clause']
That was fun.,['Declarative Clause']
"At this point, it’s been more than half a year that we’ve been living in isolation… and then Thanksgiving comes along… a holiday where we’re all supposed to get together.",['Declarative Clause']
"So once again, the question was… what do we do?",['Interrogative Clause']
"There was an older story from before the pandemic…about a vacuum repair guy from Melrose, Massachusetts named Scott MacCaulay… and he hosts Thanksgiving dinner for strangers.",['Declarative Clause']
We thought maybe he’d have the answer…Here’s his original story from 2010…,['Declarative Clause']
My folks decided to get divorced.,['Declarative Clause']
"And if you were nice to one, the other one would get mad with you.",['Declarative Clause']
"When October came, I thought, gee, you know, what’s going to happen at Thanksgiving?",['Declarative Clause']
"So I just thought, well, there must be some other people that are in the same boat.",['Declarative Clause']
Why should they have that rotten feeling?,['Interrogative Clause']
Why should they be stuck home alone?,['Interrogative Clause']
"So, I put an ad in the local paper and offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner for twelve people.",['Declarative Clause']
People came and they had a good time.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, last year 84 people showed up.",['Declarative Clause']
What I do is transform the hall at the First Baptist Church to look as close to home as I can get it.,['Declarative Clause']
I have a fake fireplace.,['Declarative Clause']
I have Norman Rockwell’s famous Thanksgiving picture framed.,['Declarative Clause']
And the way I test my success or failure is how long they stay.,['Declarative Clause']
"Last year, I had a family show up two hours late.",['Declarative Clause']
He had lost his job and they had heard about the dinner and wanted something to eat.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, some of these people might not have anything, but they always find something that they can be grateful for.",['Declarative Clause']
"My goal is always to have nobody sign up, ’cause that means everybody’s got a place to go and everybody’s okay.",['Declarative Clause']
And that’s what keeps me going twenty-five years later.,['Declarative Clause']
So in 2020…we reached back out to Scott to see how he was dealing with this new reality.,['Declarative Clause']
"Well, turns out…instead of hosting an in-person event… Scott partnered with a local restaurant to give away free meals from the window of his vacuum repair shop.",['Declarative Clause']
"Using StoryCorps Connect, Scott spoke with his friend Loretta Saint-Louis, who he met during one of his dinners.",['Declarative Clause']
I was new to Melrose and I didn’t really know people here.,['Declarative Clause']
And I saw the advertisement.,['Declarative Clause']
I think it was in the paper.,['Declarative Clause']
And it took a bit of courage for me to just call you.,['Declarative Clause']
What was your first impression of this crazy guy on the other end of the phone?,['Interrogative Clause']
You were so friendly.,['Declarative Clause']
"I was blown away, all the care that you put into it.",['Declarative Clause']
It felt like I was going to a family Thanksgiving event.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m going to miss that a lot.,['Declarative Clause']
"Yeah, because of the COVID-19 crisis.",['Declarative Clause']
I’ve offered people alternatives to us getting together.,['Declarative Clause']
"It’s nice to know that you still want to feed us, but it’s the togetherness of it that’s important.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, all the people that come …they are young and old, male, female from different places, backgrounds, and countries.",['Declarative Clause']
"And what I find always interesting is despite the great differences, they all have similar things that they’re thankful for.",['Declarative Clause']
And some of them will make you cry.,['Declarative Clause']
Somebody will say their son’s now speaking to them.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, no matter what your condition is, health-wise, financial, or newly divorced, or newly widowed, they focus for some time on good things.",['Declarative Clause']
And I think that’s \nwonderful.,['Declarative Clause']
What advice do you have for people who will be alone this year?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I would say call everybody and anybody that you can think of tell them, “I love you.”",['Declarative Clause']
"Don’t talk with your mouth full, you know, we don’t want spraying turkey all over the computer screen or the phone.",['Interrogative Clause']
But connect with as many people that you think might be alone or would appreciate a call and tell them you’re thinking of them.,['Imperative Clause']
"My philosophy is: I can’t fix the country or the world or even the town, but I can brighten my own corner.",['Declarative Clause']
"It doesn’t matter what any of the differences that we can divide ourselves with, if your neighbor’s house is burning down, you run to put the fire out.",['Declarative Clause']
"I’m not going to sit around, talk about it.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m just going to do something about it.,['Declarative Clause']
And that’s sort of what the Thanksgiving dinner is all about.,['Declarative Clause']
"That would be my hope for America, that everybody would just brighten the corner where they are.",['Declarative Clause']
"We checked in with Scott again this year, and he’s still running those takeaway dinners. Last year, he served 100 people.",['Declarative Clause']
It was just a weird weird time.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, and… It is so bananas to think back to it now.",['Declarative Clause']
"But I really do think that it generally felt, just, good to do something.",['Declarative Clause']
And I’m the first person to say that technology is not the solution to a lot of problems.,['Declarative Clause']
"But it is nice when there is something where, like, you can think of a way to do something that just wouldn’t be possible otherwise.",['Declarative Clause']
"And, again, hopefully, if you’ve done your job right, the technology somewhat melts away, and it’s just communication. It’s just people.",['Declarative Clause']
And it continues today.,['Declarative Clause']
"It’s still what we use to record, you know, a lot of interviews.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s really opened us up to connect people who have something to say to each other but they’re not in the same place.,['Declarative Clause']
"I always used to joke with people that whenever there’s a zombie apocalypse, right, I’m not going to be much use because a lot of my skills have to do with plugging things together and, like, electronics and computers.",['Declarative Clause']
"But in this case, all these computer nerdy skills actually came in handy when it had to actually wire things together.",['Declarative Clause']
"So you know, that was nice.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s all for this week’s episode.,['Declarative Clause']
It was produced by Max Jungreis and Jud Esty-Kendall.,['Declarative Clause']

Time now for StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
Joseph Rogers Britton has spent 40 years caring for others.,['Declarative Clause']
" In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV.",['Declarative Clause']
And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing.,['Declarative Clause']
You know what the biggest joy was?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Finding a smile in that small, sick child.",['Declarative Clause']
That just made my week.,['Declarative Clause']
During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that’s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.",['Declarative Clause']
"We met doing volunteer work, HIV work. Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV.",['Declarative Clause']
"Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning.",['Declarative Clause']
"We missed every single dinner date, every movie.",['Exclamatory Clause']
And that led into a thirty year relationship.,['Declarative Clause']
And then we found out that we both love gardening.,['Declarative Clause']
"Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses. ",['Declarative Clause']
We were giving it out to those who don’t get out.,['Declarative Clause']
"Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I’ve known you.",['Declarative Clause']
"When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.",['Declarative Clause']
And it’s not the glitz.,['Declarative Clause']
It’s the simple touches.,['Declarative Clause']
"You know, so many people… thought that HIV is a death sentence.",['Declarative Clause']
You see everything as an opportunity because you’re here.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ve always been very proud of the fact that I’m a living individual with HIV.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, you really believe and you live – if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.",['Declarative Clause']
I can guarantee it.,['Declarative Clause']
"We would snip them all down, and we’re talking about a carload of nothing but roses.",['Declarative Clause']
"And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we’d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it’s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we’d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother.",['Declarative Clause']
And we’d leave bouquets of roses at their door.,['Declarative Clause']
And we’d do this all night long.,['Declarative Clause']
"Over the last year, Mary Johnson-Roy has been getting a steady stream of visitors… all there to basically say one thing",['Declarative Clause']
"Thank you, Mary. I love you.",['Exclamatory Clause']
I thank you so much just for being in my life.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"I love you, sister Mary.",['Exclamatory Clause']
Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Mary lives in Minneapolis.,['Declarative Clause']
And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide.,['Declarative Clause']
" If it wasn’t for Mary, I don’t know where I would be as a grieving mother.",['Declarative Clause']
"Well, I know that I wouldn’t be here. ",['Declarative Clause']
"Mary’s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.",['Declarative Clause']
But there’s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work…,['Declarative Clause']
Her connection to the man who killed her son…,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Mary Johnson.,['Declarative Clause']
I am Oshea Israel.,['Declarative Clause']
My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I’m her second son.,['Declarative Clause']
"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m Jasmyn Morris…,['Declarative Clause']
 And I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
This week… a story you have to hear to believe.,['Declarative Clause']
"Let’s start at the beginning… in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis…",['Declarative Clause']
"My son, Laramiun, was intelligent.",['Declarative Clause']
Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level.,['Declarative Clause']
"He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy.",['Declarative Clause']
"He grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.",['Declarative Clause']
Fast forward to 1993…when Laramiun was 20…,['Declarative Clause']
"He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that’s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.",['Declarative Clause']
"One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time.",['Declarative Clause']
They got into a fight… and Oshea shot and killed him.,['Declarative Clause']
Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.,['Declarative Clause']
"And over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son.",['Declarative Clause']
And after a decade of trying to find peace… she decided to try something different… to visit Oshea in prison.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.",['Declarative Clause']
"That’s Regina Irwin, one of Mary’s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day…",['Declarative Clause']
"As Mary was walking up to go to the prison, she stopped and she looked at me, and she said, “Regina, I can’t do it.”",['Declarative Clause']
And Mary was bending down almost like she was in labor.,['Declarative Clause']
"And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom.",['Declarative Clause']
"And when she came out, she had prayed… and she was ready to go in.",['Declarative Clause']
And Mary said “I will not sit here and not allow him to have a glass that he can drink water from just like everyone else here.”,['Declarative Clause']
And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink.,['Declarative Clause']
We’ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next.,['Imperative Clause']
You and I met at Stillwater Prison.,['Declarative Clause']
But you were not that 16-year-old.,['Declarative Clause']
You were a grown man.,['Declarative Clause']
I shared with you about my son.,['Declarative Clause']
Join us again next week for our final episode… as we wrap up this special series…,['Imperative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Declarative Clause']
I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
"Artwork for this episode was created by Liz McCarty, you can see it on our website. ",['Declarative Clause']
"There, you can learn more about recording your own interview.",['Declarative Clause']
Max Jungreis is our Associate Producer.,['Declarative Clause']
"Special thanks to Ian Gonzalez, Gaspar Caro, Liyna Anwar, Roselyn Almonte and especially…Brian Mogren.",['Declarative Clause']
This episode was produced by Jasmyn Morris and Jud Esty-Kendall.,['Declarative Clause']
Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd. ,['Declarative Clause']
"And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can– just hug you like I would my own mother, you know.",['Declarative Clause']
"And I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you– I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you.",['Declarative Clause']
I treat you as I would treat my son.,['Declarative Clause']
And our relationship is beyond belief.,['Declarative Clause']
We live next door to one another.,['Declarative Clause']
 I find those things funny because it’s a relationship with a mother for real.,['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t see him graduate.,['Declarative Clause']
Now you’re going to college.,['Declarative Clause']
I’ll have the opportunity to see you graduate.,['Declarative Clause']
I didn’t see him getting married.,['Declarative Clause']
"Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to experience that with you.",['Declarative Clause']
Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation.,['Declarative Clause']
It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.,['Declarative Clause']
"I know it’s not an easy thing, you know, to be able to share our story together.",['Declarative Clause']
So I admire that you can do this.,['Declarative Clause']
" I love you, lady.",['Declarative Clause']
" I love you too, son",['Declarative Clause']
After that interview aired on NPR… Mary and Oshea continued sharing their story far beyond Minneapolis.,['Declarative Clause']
We were invited to a lot of different places.,['Declarative Clause']
She spoke at conferences around the world on love and forgiveness and met with world leaders.,['Declarative Clause']
President Barack Obama even thanked her for her service.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s all because of how Mary has helped other families who have lost children to homicide.,['Declarative Clause']
"She started an organization in 2005 called From Death to Life… that provides healing groups for mothers on both sides of a tragedy, and encourages forgiveness when mothers are ready.",['Declarative Clause']
And through her work… she met the love of her life… a man named Ed Roy.,['Declarative Clause']
I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old.,['Declarative Clause']
You took me under your wing; that’s why I called you my angel.,['Declarative Clause']
They recorded that interview in 2017.,['Declarative Clause']
What about me?” ,['Interrogative Clause']
But you know what?,['Interrogative Clause']
 How many men would do the things that you do as far as taking care of me?,['Interrogative Clause']

"Do you mind if we spend some time sharing with you, Mother Mary, what you mean to us?",['Interrogative Clause']
Ok. Amen,['Declarative Clause']
All right. Amen.,['Declarative Clause']
"Love you, ladies.",['Declarative Clause']
We love you.,['Declarative Clause']
"I’m like, wait, what’s going on?",['Interrogative Clause']
She’s six years old now.,['Declarative Clause']
His name is Ed,['Declarative Clause']
"Well Mary, it’s been 12 years since we sat down for our first StoryCorps interview and it’s more emotional for me this time.",['Declarative Clause']
She’s how old now?,['Interrogative Clause']
"We’ve mentioned a lot of numbers over the past few episodes… 27,000 interviews on the mobile tour… 17,000 interviews in just one day when we released the app.",['Declarative Clause']
I’m Michael Garofalo,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Declarative Clause']
From NPR… this is StoryCorps Then and Now… celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.,['Declarative Clause']
" My dad was named Richard Isay, and he was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst.",['Declarative Clause']
"For many years, he saw only gay patients and was kind of a revolutionary in the psychoanalytic world in saying that homosexuality was not a disease and advocating in the work he did for helping LGBTQ folks find love.",['Declarative Clause']
I accidentally discovered he was gay when I was 21 and our nuclear family exploded.,['Declarative Clause']
"Sylvia Rivera, who’s kind of known as the Rosa Parks of the Stonewall movement, became one of my best friends and was the centerpiece of this radio documentary, which was named Remembering Stonewall, and I dedicated it to my dad.",['Declarative Clause']
"In some ways, was that you trying to figure out this time in your life where there was a secret, like, life before your dad coming out?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. I was very interested to understand what he had gone through.,['Declarative Clause']
What truly was the happiest moment of your life? ,['Interrogative Clause']
How do you want to be remembered?,['Interrogative Clause']
You think about dying? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Are you scared of dying? ,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore.",['Declarative Clause']
What do you think is the most important thing that you’ve accomplished in your life?,['Interrogative Clause']
What are you proudest of? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Were you unhappy when I was a kid?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, I think I was happy when you were a kid.",['Declarative Clause']

Her partner had already been married and raised children… even grandchildren…,['Declarative Clause']
How has your life been different than what you thought it was gonna to be?,['Interrogative Clause']
Do you know what I mean by that?,['Interrogative Clause']
"You know, you and I talk about most things but this is the first time that we’ve ever talked about the fact that I’m gay and I guess what I wanna ask you is, does it embarrass you to have a gay grandma?",['Interrogative Clause']
No,['Declarative Clause']
No?,['Interrogative Clause']
 I love you sweetheart.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Love you too.,['Exclamatory Clause']
"When he was 8 years old, Gabe came to StoryCorps in Arizona, where he lives, with his mom Chris, and they talked about how a weekend at camp for transgender kids transformed his life.",['Declarative Clause']
"And that was huge for you, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah.,['Declarative Clause']
You think they might try to hurt you in some way? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah. ,['Declarative Clause']
Were you ever worried about telling me that you were transgender? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Did you ever try to tell me and then change your mind? ,['Interrogative Clause']
How many times do you think? ,['Interrogative Clause']
Four times?,['Interrogative Clause']
I was worried that you liked me as a girl. ,['Declarative Clause']
Because we used to have a lot of fun?,['Interrogative Clause']
Do we still have fun? ,['Interrogative Clause']

"This episode was produced by Jud Esty-Kendall and Jasmyn Morris with Max Jungreis, Von Diaz, and Kayla Lattimore",['Declarative Clause']
Our Technical Director is Jarrett Floyd. ,['Declarative Clause']
The kind of man that can help others see different viewpoints.,['Declarative Clause']
What kind of man do you want to be?,['Interrogative Clause']
How would you describe yourself today?,['Interrogative Clause']
You know what I mean?,['Interrogative Clause']
"We always thought it was just kind of a phase and we told you that, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
Did you ever feel jealous that it was my friends who taught me how to pee standing up?,['Interrogative Clause']
That conversation was recorded on our mobile tour in 2015… ,['Declarative Clause']
I was literally there since day one.,['Declarative Clause']
"Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?",['Interrogative Clause']
When do I ever take vacations?,['Interrogative Clause']
And when am I gonna retire?,['Interrogative Clause']
You know what I mean?,['Interrogative Clause']
Not just your B.S. best.,['Exclamatory Clause']
It doesn’t feel that bad.,['Exclamatory Clause']
You’re always my barometer.,['Exclamatory Clause']
You never let anyone down.,['Exclamatory Clause']
That’s what sets you apart.,['Exclamatory Clause']
nd as far as you doing the business?,['Interrogative Clause']
You started younger than me.,['Declarative Clause']
My name is Rob Rigano.,['Declarative Clause']
"And, uh, what’s your relationship to me?",['Interrogative Clause']
"We’re brothers, unfortunately.",['Declarative Clause']
Rob Rigano lives in New York and his older brother Phil lives near San Diego.,['Declarative Clause']
They see each other once a year and on one of those visits in 2006 the StoryCorps airstream trailer was parked near Phil’s home.,['Declarative Clause']
"Wait, what happened?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Went down the driveway, I jumped out of the car, and it went down the driveway.",['Declarative Clause']

Yes.,['Declarative Clause']
Yeah?,['Interrogative Clause']
"No, you didn’t Bite a horse, Rob.",['Declarative Clause']
I thought I did?,['Interrogative Clause']
"The story was you wanted to go up and pet the horse and the man said “he can pet it, the horse won’t bite” and mom said “I’m not afraid of the horse biting my son I’m afraid of what my son might do to the horse.”",['Declarative Clause']
What’s your happiest memory?,['Interrogative Clause']
Yeah?,['Interrogative Clause']
"Not your nature, maybe, you know, doing things?",['Interrogative Clause']
We miss those things because he was always a glue that bound the family together.,['Exclamatory Clause']
Anything else Rob?,['Interrogative Clause']
That’s all?,['Interrogative Clause']
For 25 years… the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City… it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay… ,['Declarative Clause']
The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building.,['Declarative Clause']
"The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows.",['Declarative Clause']
"It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.",['Declarative Clause']
"It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy.",['Declarative Clause']
‘Should I tell my parents? Shouldn’t I tell my parents?’,['Interrogative Clause']
My family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic.,['Declarative Clause']
"Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school… and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14.",['Declarative Clause']
"She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.",['Declarative Clause']
She felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters.,['Declarative Clause']
"It would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother…which… is something I wanted.",['Declarative Clause']
"The impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay… there’s nothing wrong with you.",['Declarative Clause']
That’s what people wanted to hear.,['Declarative Clause']
"They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you.",['Declarative Clause']
"You know, you had to tell them that they weren’t alone. ",['Declarative Clause']
Cecile Doyle died in 2019.,['Declarative Clause']
Do you remember the day we actually had the reunion?,['Interrogative Clause']
So what a gift they gave us.,['Declarative Clause']
They certainly did.,['Declarative Clause']
So now you’re going to get diehard Democrats and diehard Republicans to the booth to really listen to each other about where their views come from?,['Interrogative Clause']
I was out of the country from 2009 until about March of 2017.,['Declarative Clause']
Who knows what’s going to happen.,['Interrogative Clause']
"When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks.",['Declarative Clause']
In earlier episodes you heard about how we brought a Mobile Booth to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina…,['Declarative Clause']
And how we built new technology to help connect people during Covid.,['Declarative Clause']
And so in this final episode we’ll learn what StoryCorps is doing NOW… ,['Declarative Clause']
And where we might go in the future… I’m Michael Garofalo.,['Declarative Clause']
And I’m Jasmyn Morris.,['Declarative Clause']
"From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now – celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.",['Declarative Clause']
That clip youjust  heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US… that’s from an initiative called One Small Step.,['Declarative Clause']
That’s Mary Bess Ser…. she works on One Small Step.,['Declarative Clause']
We just want people to talk. ,['Imperative Clause']
One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.,['Declarative Clause']
One of the keys is that phrase “very specific circumstances” – so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.,['Declarative Clause']
Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other… but One Small Step interviews are between strangers. ,['Declarative Clause']
The fact that they’re strangers really makes it less threatening.,['Declarative Clause']
So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother – that may or may not be my story –  it’s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there’s no relationship at stake.,['Declarative Clause']
"They can select from a list of terms to identify themselves… things like parent, grandparent or veteran.",['Declarative Clause']
And they write a short bio… describing themselves in their own words – and that gets shared with their interview partner.,['Declarative Clause']
Then someone from StoryCorps – like Mary Bess – matches them up with a stranger.,['Declarative Clause']
What did you think?,['Interrogative Clause']
"I mean, that really is something, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
"Here’s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona.",['Declarative Clause']
Their connection… was parenting.,['Declarative Clause']
You know?,['Interrogative Clause']
"And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one?",['Interrogative Clause']
Right?,['Interrogative Clause']
It doesn’t ever wear out. Right?,['Interrogative Clause']
So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?,['Interrogative Clause']
Who knew how that was going to go?,['Interrogative Clause']
"We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right?",['Interrogative Clause']
It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right?,['Interrogative Clause']
But you’ve never run for office? ,['Interrogative Clause']
What do you do for a living?,['Interrogative Clause']
Really?,['Interrogative Clause']
Two ply?,['Interrogative Clause']
Is that right?,['Interrogative Clause']
