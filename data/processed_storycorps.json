[{"text": "Annie Russell (AR): Time now for StoryCorps.\nJoseph Rogers Britton has spent 40 years caring for others.\nJoseph Rogers Britton (JRB): In the early days, I used to sit with babies who were positive for HIV. And all I did was just hold them and rock and sing. You know what the biggest joy was? Finding a smile in that small, sick child. That just made my week.\nAR: During the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s Joseph cared for other gay men living with HIV.\nAnd, as he told his friend Jeff Moore at StoryCorps, that\u2019s how he fell in love with another caretaker named Steven.\nJRB: We met doing volunteer work, HIV work. Me caring for someone who was dying with HIV. Our first dates, for the first six months, were sitting on a porch swing every single day and talking till three in the morning. We missed every single dinner date, every movie. [laughs]\u00a0\nAnd that led into a thirty year relationship.\nAnd then we found out that we both love gardening. Steven and I used to have a tradition that every fall when the winter freeze on the rose gardens, we would go and raid the roses.\u00a0\nWe would snip them all down, and we\u2019re talking about a carload of nothing but roses. And then we would go home, have glasses of wine, and we\u2019d fill up every vessel we could find, whether it\u2019s a soup can, a bottle, or whatever, and we\u2019d secretly run around to every single house of a senior citizen, a single mother.\u00a0\nAnd we\u2019d leave bouquets of roses at their door. And we\u2019d do this all night long. We were giving it out to those who don\u2019t get out.\nJeff Moore (JM): Certainly, that kindness that you emanate has meant a lot to me since I\u2019ve known you.\nJRB: When you experience people living and dying together, it breaks it down to the things that are important.\nAnd it\u2019s not the glitz. It\u2019s the simple touches.\nYou know, so many people\u2026 thought that HIV is a death sentence. I\u2019ve always been very proud of the fact that I\u2019m a living individual with HIV. You see everything as an opportunity because you\u2019re here.\nJM: And, you really believe and you live \u2013 if you put kindness out there, kindness is gonna come back.\nJRB: I can guarantee it.\n\nClose"},

I love you.\n\u00a0\nANN: I thank you so much just for being in my life. I love you, sister Mary.\n\u00a0\nPRINCESS: Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.\n\u00a0\nMG: Mary lives in Minneapolis. And has spent many years supporting mothers who have lost children to homicide.\n\u00a0\nCONNIE: If it wasn\u2019t for Mary, I don\u2019t know where I would be as a grieving mother. Well, I know that I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: Mary\u2019s dedicated to this work because in 1993, she lost her own son, Laramiun Byrd.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: But there\u2019s something else about Mary that makes her uniquely qualified to do this work\u2026\n\u00a0\nHer connection to the man who killed her son\u2026\n\u00a0\nMary: My name is Mary Johnson.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOshea: I am Oshea Israel. My relationship to Mary Johnson is: I\u2019m her second son.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now\u2026 celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps. I\u2019m Jasmyn Morris\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: And I\u2019m Michael Garofalo. This week\u2026 a story you have to hear to believe.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: Let\u2019s start at the beginning\u2026 in the 80s, when Mary Johnson-Roy was a single mother raising her only child in Minneapolis\u2026\n\u00a0\nMJR: My son, Laramiun, was intelligent. Sixth grade he was at a twelfth grade reading level. He went to a private school, so he was the little preppy. He grew up in church, so he always had a suit on on Sundays.\n\u00a0\nJM: Fast forward to 1993\u2026when Laramiun was 20\u2026\n\u00a0\nMJR: He was blessed with the brains to do something differently, but that\u2019s the lifestyle that he chose: selling drugs, you know, fast money.\n\u00a0\nMG: One night, he went to a party, where he crossed paths with Oshea Israel, who was 16 at the time. They got into a fight\u2026 and Oshea shot and killed him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Oshea was convicted of murder and sent to prison.\n\u00a0\nAnd over the years, Mary struggled to make sense of what happened to her son. And after a decade of trying to find peace\u2026 she decided to try something different\u2026 to visit Oshea in prison.\n\u00a0\nRegina Irwin (RI): I\u2019m telling you, what took place that day was amazing.\n\u00a0\nMG: That\u2019s Regina Irwin, one of Mary\u2019s closest friends who went with her to the prison that day\u2026\n\u00a0\nRI: As Mary was walking up to go to the prison, she stopped and she looked at me, and she said, \u201cRegina, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d And Mary was bending down almost like she was in labor. And as we got inside, she eventually told the woman that was gonna take us in to meet Oshea, that she had to go to the restroom. And when she came out, she had prayed\u2026 and she was ready to go in.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs we were sitting at the table to meet Oshea, they had left a pitcher of water but they didn\u2019t leave a glass for the man that had taken her son\u2019s life. And Mary said \u201cI will not sit here and not allow him to have a glass that he can drink water from just like everyone else here.\u201d And the guards brought in a glass for him to drink.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: We\u2019ll let Mary and Oshea tell you what happened next. This is from a conversation they had in 2011\u2026 shortly after Oshea finished serving his sentence.\n\u00a0\nMary Johnson (MJ): You and I met at Stillwater Prison. I wanted to know if you were in the same mindset of what I remembered from court, where I wanted to go over and hurt you. But you were not that 16-year-old. You were a grown man. I shared with you about my son.\n\u00a0\nOshea Israel (OI): And he became human to me. You know, when I met you it was like, ok, this guy is real. And then, when it was time to go, you broke down and started shedding tears and the initial thing to do was just try and hold you up as best I can\u2013 just hug you like I would my own mother, you know.\n\u00a0\nMJ: After you left the room, I began to say: \u201dI just hugged the man that murdered my son.\u201d\u00a0 And I instantly knew that all that anger and the animosity, all the stuff I had in my heart for 12 years for you\u2013 I knew it was over, that I had totally forgiven you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOI: As far as receiving forgiveness from you\u2013 sometimes I still don\u2019t know how to take it because I haven\u2019t totally forgiven myself yet. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m learning from you \u2013 I won\u2019t say that I have learned yet\u2013 because it\u2019s still a process that I\u2019m going through.\n\u00a0\nMJ: I treat you as I would treat my son. And our relationship is beyond belief. We live next door to one another.\n\u00a0\nOI: Yeah. So you can see what I\u2019m doing\u2013 you know first hand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJ: Uh-huh\u2026\n\u00a0\nOI: We actually bump into each other all the time leaving in and out of the house. And, you know, our conversations, they come from \u201dBoy, how come you ain\u2019t called over here to check on me in a couple of days? You ain\u2019t even asked me if I need my garbage to go out!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMJ: Uh-huh.\n\u00a0\nOI: I find those things funny because it\u2019s a relationship with a mother for real.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJ: Well, my natural son is no longer here. I didn\u2019t see him graduate. Now you\u2019re going to college. I\u2019ll have the opportunity to see you graduate. I didn\u2019t see him getting married. Hopefully one day, I\u2019ll be able to experience that with you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOI: Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner that which you are is my motivation. It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path. You still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you\u2013 it\u2019s amazing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJ: I know it\u2019s not an easy thing, you know, to be able to share our story together. Even with us sitting here looking at each other right now, I know it\u2019s not an easy thing. So I admire that you can do this.\n\u00a0\nOI: I love you, lady.\n\u00a0\nMJ: I love you too, son.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: After that interview aired on NPR\u2026 Mary and Oshea continued sharing their story far beyond Minneapolis.\n\u00a0\nJM: They hit the road\u2026 visiting churches, synagogues, and prisons\u2026=\n\u00a0\nOI: We were invited to a lot of different places. We\u2019ve had a lot of moments, us walking through the airports together, trying to figure out where we\u2019re going. And as we share our story, we still get to hear each other\u2019s parts which brings us even more closer. And it seemed like the mission kind of took off, even to the point where it grew its own legs and started running.\n\u00a0\nMG: They were on every national media outlet you can think of and international too.\n\u00a0\nShe spoke at conferences around the world on love and forgiveness and met with world leaders. President Barack Obama even thanked her for her service.\n\u00a0\nJM: That\u2019s all because of how Mary has helped other families who have lost children to homicide.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe started an organization in 2005 called From Death to Life\u2026 that provides healing groups for mothers on both sides of a tragedy, and encourages forgiveness when mothers are ready.\n\u00a0\nMG: And through her work\u2026 she met the love of her life\u2026 a man named Ed Roy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEd Roy (ER): When my first-born and my one and only son was murdered, my daughters had asked me to go to the church to hear you speak. I wasn\u2019t ready for the forgiveness part, but I was at a loss. Like I shared with you, I thought God took my boy and was punishing me for my own crimes. I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old. But with you being there, I saw hope. You took me under your wing; that\u2019s why I called you my angel.\n\u00a0\nThen I remember, I had that dream \u2014 that was just before our wedding. And your son was saying, \u201dYeah, Mom! Alright!\u201d You know, \u201dRight on!\u201d And my son was saying, \u201dYeah, Dad. \u2018Bout time you got it right!\u201d [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nMJR: [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nER: As the years and time goes by, you know where I\u2019ve been. You know where I hurt.\n\u00a0\nMJR: And I know you take care of me when I\u2019m not doing well. The anniversary is coming up of my son\u2019s murder and I\u2019m grateful to have someone there that has experienced the same thing that I have.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nER: That empty hole is always going to be there in our hearts. But I feel like when we together and we able to listen to one another\u2019s heartbeats, it says a lot.\n\u00a0\nMJR: I\u2019m thankful; I really am. You\u2019re a good man.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMG: They recorded that interview in 2017. But recently, Ed has had to care for Mary in an entirely different way.\n\u00a0\nStay with us\u2026\n\u00a0\nBREAK\n\u00a0\nJM: 10 years after we first met Mary\u2026 she was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia\u2026 sometimes described as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s all rolled into one.\n\u00a0\nMG: And her husband, Ed, has been her main caretaker.\n\u00a0\nJust a few months ago\u2026 the two of them sat down for another interview.\n\u00a0\nER: There was a lot of things that neither one of us didn\u2019t understand. It was things like leaving something on the stove, parking your car a few houses down the street. And as it progressed, we started understanding together what we was up against. Like, when you started seeing things \u2014 the invisible people. And we talked about it, honey. You know, we made humor out of them. We call them the little people [Laughs].\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nER: Like when you had several bowls of cereal out and you was feeding them. And I said, \u201cYou giving all my Cap\u2019n Crunch to the little people. What about me?\u201d [Laughs] And you started laughing, you know. We have so many moments.\n\u00a0\nMJR: Yeah, I need to write them down.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nER: They are written down. They are written down in our hearts, honey.\n\u00a0\nSometimes I think about when people say that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: \u2026to waste. yeah.\n\u00a0\nER: But you know what? The heart is the terrible thing to waste.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, don\u2019t think about just the memory things; we\u2019re here to remember for each other. Don\u2019t worry about the reading because I\u2019m here and read to you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: How many men would do the things that you do as far as taking care of me? Like putting on my shoes today.\n\u00a0\nER: That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\u00a0\nMJR: Yeah.\n\u00a0\nER: You know, it\u2019s about us taking care of one another. You\u2019ve given me, Mary, a reason for living. I always told you that, though.\n\u00a0\nMJR: Uh-huh.\n\u00a0\nER: So that\u2019s what I see you doing and giving to other people is hope. You have to have some kind of hope to hold on to. When you don\u2019t have that, you don\u2019t have nothing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true what they say about when, uh, when they say wait on God, that he\u2019ll send you that person. You know, he knew what was in my heart.\n\u00a0\nMJR: Wow. I love you.\n\u00a0\nER: I love you.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\nJM: When word of Mary\u2019s illness started to circulate among the families she\u2019s helped\u2026 that\u2019s when the visits we told you about earlier began\u2026\n\u00a0\nBRIAN: You\u2019ve got a full slate of visitors for today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMARY: Why are you saying somebody wants to come and sit and talk to me?\n\u00a0\nBRIAN: Oh Mary, the world would be lined up if they were invited.\n\u00a0\nMG: That\u2019s Brian Mogren. One of Mary\u2019s close friends and the Director of the St. Jane House, where Mary\u2019s healing groups have been meeting for more than 15 years.\n\u00a0\nJM: He started hosting \u201cThursdays with Mary\u201d \u2026 so family and friends\u2026 including those Mary has helped\u2026 can now help her remember her impact. And at Mary\u2019s request\u2026 Brian\u2019s been recording these conversations.\n\u00a0\nGWEN: When I saw Brian\u2019s note about meeting with you on Thursdays, I\u2019m like, Oh, let me get my name on that list. Cause I want to see my friend.\n\u00a0\nMARY: Yeah. I\u2019m so glad that you did.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: That\u2019s Mary\u2019s longtime friend Gwen Chandler.\n\u00a0\nGWEN: Baby, you will never have any idea how much you\u2019ve influenced people\u2019s lives. And people will be saying your name for generations and generations.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMICHELE: I met someone recently, her brother was murdered when she was younger, and she wants to meet the person who killed her brother.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: Michele Braley is a social worker who was also with Mary at the prison the day that Mary met Oshea\u2026 And they\u2019ve been friends ever since\u2026\n\u00a0\nAnd she said, partly, she had the courage to do that because she knew of your story and that you met Oshea. She\u2019s never met you but you gave her courage. You know, we don\u2019t know all the lives we impact, do we? You know, but I wanted to get a chance to tell you that, Mary.\n\u00a0\nJM: And despite her illness\u2026Mary\u2019s still been helping to run her healing group for mothers every other Saturday\u2026\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nCONSTANCE: My name is Constance Styles and my son Dante Gray was murdered in 1994.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEBONY: Well I\u2019m Ebony Robinson. My son\u2019s name is Andre Riley Jr and I lost him July 3rd, 2016.\n\u00a0\nCONNIE: My son was murdered in 2016, December 25th.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nANGEL: My name is Angel Cradle. The loss of my son Dewayne Tyson Sr. happened in 2007 and the loss of my grandson Dewayne Tyson Jr. happened in 2018.\n\u00a0\nANN: My name is Ann and my son, Maurice Wilson, was killed October the sixth, 1997.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPRINCESS: My name is Princess Titus and my son, Anthony Titus, was hit by a bullet intended for another child two weeks after his 16th birthday, right before the fireworks on July 4th, 2010.\n\u00a0\nJM: Some of the mothers who were there this particular day\u2026 turned the tables on Mary\u2026\n\u00a0\nPRINCESS: Do you mind if we spend some time sharing with you, Mother Mary, what you mean to us?\n\u00a0\nMARY: Ok. Amen\n\u00a0\nPRINCESS: All right. Amen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI remember calling Mary around Mother\u2019s Day. She said, this is just how it gets around Mother\u2019s Day and holidays are gonna be like that. So to have a woman who did walk that walk to let me know that I was not crazy and that we were not alone. Loneliness doesn\u2019t help grief and Mary did not allow us to be lonely.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEBONY: So we\u2019re forever grateful to you, Ms. Mary. It\u2019s not a happy situation, but we are blessed to be able to have you as our shepherd.\n\u00a0\nANN: Ooh, sister Mary, you mean the world to me. I admire you so much. No matter how hard things have been for you lately, you are still here teaching us and showing us what true love is.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPRINCESS: I think we all in tears around the table now. So Mary, thank you for modeling\u2026 shining your little light everywhere you go. Thank you Mary Johnson-Roy.\n\u00a0\nMARY: Love you, ladies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMOTHERS: We love you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMARY: Appreciate you so much, you don\u2019t know.\n\u00a0\nMG: But for all that\u2019s happened over the past year\u2026 there was one person who hadn\u2019t had this kind of conversation with Mary yet\u2026 Oshea.\n\u00a0\nJM: Her illness has affected him too. It\u2019s hard to see this woman who has meant so much to him declining. She\u2019s not able to travel anymore or share their story together, which was such a big part of his life. It gave him purpose. So as much as she still means to him, he\u2019s been hesitant to talk with her directly about her health.\n\u00a0\nBut finally, this summer, Oshea decided to sit down with Mary again\u2026 and StoryCorps was there to record it.\n\u00a0\nOI: Well Mary, it\u2019s been 12 years since we sat down for our first StoryCorps interview and it\u2019s more emotional for me this time. You know, with everything that we\u2019ve been through and we\u2019ve dealt with and everything that\u2019s going on now. You know, it hurts to see. I\u2019m used to the lady that fusses at me all the time. (Laughs) But you\u2019re strong and you\u2019re going to fight for whatever you believe in. And I still see you fighting.\n\u00a0\nMJR: I\u2019m glad to see you. I\u2019m glad to see how you\u2019re doing. So I thank God for that chance today.\n\u00a0\nOI: A lot has changed. I, myself, have two children: my son, he\u2019s three. And a little girl.\n\u00a0\nMJR: She\u2019s how old now?\n\u00a0\nOI: She\u2019s six years old now. I remember when she was born you helped me get the car seat for her. But since we were living next door to each other, you left me for another fella. His name is Ed [Laughs].\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nOI: I remember when I first got wind of you and Ed going out on dates. I\u2019m like, wait, what\u2019s going on? You was mine. [Laughs] But you all blessed me with the opportunity to not only be present in the wedding but to walk you down the aisle, that was, like, again, your words: beyond belief.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: Yeah. I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019ve been proud for a while.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOI: It has been an amazing journey. From a hug to you becoming a grandmother through me with my kids, to you just being a beacon of light to a lot of people. On our last interview we ended it with me saying \u201cI love you, lady.\u201d And I still feel the same way.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: Mary\u2019s still living at home with Ed\u2026 and goes to a daytime memory care center three times a week. Brian has set up a GoFundMe to help support them.\n\u00a0\nBut one thing is clear\u2026 even as Mary\u2019s memory dims\u2026 her light does not.\n\u00a0\nMJR: This little light of mine, I\u2019m gonna let it shine, yeah. This little light of mine\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m gonna let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine. Let it shine. Everywhere I go.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMothers: Everywhere I go\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: I\u2019m gonna let it shine\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMothers: I\u2019m gonna let it shine\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: Yes\u2026\n\u00a0\nMothers: Everywhere I go, I\u2019m gonna let it shine.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMJR: Everywhere\u2026\n\u00a0\nMothers: Everywhere I go\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nALL: I\u2019m gonna let it shine\u2026 Let it shine.

If we\u2019re building an archive of American voices\u2026 we need to make sure that the archive reflects who actually lives here in the United States.\n\u00a0\nMG: So while StoryCorps is open to anyone who wants to do an interview\u2026 we\u2019ve worked to make sure that stories and voices that don\u2019t often get included in the historical record ARE captured in the StoryCorps archive.\n\u00a0\nJM: We call these efforts \u201cinitiatives\u201d\u2026 you\u2019ve heard about one already \u2013 StoryCorps Griot.\n\u00a0\nMG: There\u2019s been quite a lot\u2026 like, Historias\u2026 or Military voices\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: Our 9/11 initiative\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: We did one for people with Memory Loss\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: \u2026and another inviting immigrants to record\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: But on this episode\u2026 we\u2019re going to focus on just one of the many that we\u2019ve done\u2026 our collection of LGBTQ voices\u2026 called StoryCorps OutLoud\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJoseph Patton: To be in the service for my country is the greatest thing I thought I did but I was kicked out for being homosexual.\n\u00a0\nElizabeth Coffey Williams: When I first came out they didn\u2019t have the words that they have today. So, attempting to tell your extraordinarily loving blue-collar parents that you were transgender was tantamount to telling them I was from Jupiter.\n\u00a0\nJerry Nadeau: We got married at the veterans home and we said, \u2019If you came to see the bride, you\u2019re out of luck!\u2019 [Laughs] Do you remember that?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohn Banvard: Yes, of course!\n\u00a0\nMG: I\u2019m Michael Garofalo.\n\u00a0\nJM: And I\u2019m Jasmyn Morris. From NPR\u2026 this is StoryCorps Then and Now\u2026 celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\nJM: So we thought if we\u2019re telling the story of StoryCorps this season, recording and sharing stories from LGTBQ folks has always been a part of that work and so why is that built into your fabric as a documentary radio producer and the founder of StoryCorps?\n\u00a0\nDave Isay (DI): It\u2019s always been an issue that\u2019s, you know, close to my heart. I\u2019m the proud son of a gay dad.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: That\u2019s Dave Isay\u2026 Jasmyn recently sat down with him to talk about the origins of OutLoud.\n\u00a0\nDI: My dad was named Richard Isay, and he was a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. For many years, he saw only gay patients and was kind of a revolutionary in the psychoanalytic world in saying that homosexuality was not a disease and advocating in the work he did for helping LGBTQ folks find love. So that was his mission in life.\n\u00a0\nI accidentally discovered he was gay when I was 21 and our nuclear family exploded. Despite, you know, many hints and clues, I was taken completely by surprise. And I was really unhappy about a lot of things, uh, and confused about a lot of things. And I withdrew from my dad for a while and it was about that time that I started making radio documentaries.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt some point after my dad came out, he did tell me the story of the Stonewall riots, which I knew nothing about. And it was just a year or two later that I made my first radio documentary and I decided to make it on Stonewall. It was the first oral history of people who had been at Stonewall, believe it or not.\n\u00a0\nMartin Boise: I remember on that night, when we saw the riot police, all of us drag queens, we linked arms like the Rockettes and sang the song we used to sing. \u201cWe are the village girls. We wear our hair in curls. We wear our dungarees above our nelly-knees\u201d and the police went crazy hearing that and they just immediately rushed us. We gave one kick and fled.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nDI: A lot of these folks had never been interviewed before about what had happened on that day. And I was very interested in what life was like before Stonewall.\n\u00a0\nSylvia Rivera, who\u2019s kind of known as the Rosa Parks of the Stonewall movement, became one of my best friends and was the centerpiece of this radio documentary, which was named Remembering Stonewall, and I dedicated it to my dad.\n\u00a0\nSYLVIA RIVERA: The era before Stonewall was a hard era. There was always the gay bashings on the drag queens by heterosexual men, women, and the police. We learned to live with it because it was part of the lifestyle at that time, I guess, but none of us were very happy about it.\n\u00a0\nJM: In some ways, was that you trying to figure out this time in your life where there was a secret, like, life before your dad coming out?\n\u00a0\nDI: Yeah. I was very interested to understand what he had gone through. And, you know, once he came out, I had found out things like, you know, he had been entrapped in a restroom, and he had to beg the cops not to put his name in the paper and, you know, destroy his life.\n\u00a0\nAnd he had been a rising star in the world of psychoanalysts, and that star was completely extinguished the minute he came out. He was shunned and, you know, refused positions and he was very moved by the fact that I had made this documentary. And, you know, it was me making an effort to understand him. And, um, that was the beginning of our rebuilding our relationship with each other.\n\u00a0\nMany, many, many years after that, I started StoryCorps. And I guess you could say that there was something about not being crazy about secrets in our lives that was part of the motivation behind starting StoryCorps \u2013 giving people the chance to say the important things to the people who are most important to us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: And that included Dave. Here he is talking with his dad in 2004\u2026.\n\u00a0\nDAVE AND DAD INTVW\n\u00a0\nDave Isay (DI): What truly was the happiest moment of your life?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRichard Isay (RI): I think I am happier now than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. So it\u2019s, um, happiness is a continuing process.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: How do you want to be remembered?\n\u00a0\nRI: Where am I going? I don\u2019t think much about that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: You think about dying?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRI: All the time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Are you scared of dying?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRI: No, I think about not having good times with Gordon anymore. It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s more an absence of that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: What do you think is the most important thing that you\u2019ve accomplished in your life? What are you proudest of?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRI: Very proud of you kids. I am very proud of the work I\u2019ve done and I am proud of being able to turn my life around and make it into a happy and good one.\n\u00a0\nDI: Were you unhappy when I was a kid?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRI: No, I think I was happy when you were a kid. And I was a good father and I loved having kids. You think I was a good father?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: I think you were a good father. You\u2019re still a good father.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nDI: My dad got sick in 2012 on a Friday. He was diagnosed with cancer and he died the next week. And he actually died on the anniversary of Stonewall on June 28th, 2012.\n\u00a0\nAt the memorial service, I announced that in honor of my dad, we would be recording stories of people who were alive before Stonewall and that\u2019s where it all began. And then, you know how I am\u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: I\u2019m like a dog with a piece of steak, you know? After my dad died, there was no way that this thing wasn\u2019t gonna get done, if it killed me. And you know, that\u2019s the way I, I guess, that I deal with, you know, grief or, or any issues, is that I just stay focused on StoryCorps and get something new done. I decided, you know, come hell or high water, we were going to do this program, which we named OutLoud.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: It launched in June 2014\u2026 LGTBQ people from all walks of life came in to tell stories of love\u2026 loss\u2026 resiliency and creativity\u2026 and\u2026 family.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: So in keeping with Dave\u2019s story\u2026 we\u2019re spending this episode hearing conversations about family\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: This first one is set in a small farming town in Washington State\u2026 where Patrick Haggerty was growing up in the 1950s. At StoryCorps he told his daughter, Robin, about something that happened in high school. There was an assembly that day and Patrick was going to perform.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPatrick Haggerty (PH): I\u2019m riding to school with my oldest brother, and on the way to school, I\u2019m putting glitter all over my face. And my brother said, \u201dWhat in the hell are you doing?\u201d And I said, \u201dI\u2019m putting on my costume.\u201d And he said, \u201dWell, I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing that.\u201d So he dropped me off at the school, and he called my dad up, and he said, \u201dDad, I think you better get up there. This is not going to look good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo my dad drove up to the high school. And he had his farmer jeans on and they had cow crap on them, and he had his clodhopper boots on. And when I saw him coming, I ducked around the hall and hid from him. And it wasn\u2019t because of what I was wearing, it was because of what he was wearing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo, the assembly goes well, and I climb in the car and I\u2019m riding home with my father. My father says to me, \u201dI was walking down the hall this morning, and I saw a kid that looked a lot like you ducking around the hall to avoid his dad. But I know it wasn\u2019t you, cause you would never do that to your dad.\u201d And I squirmed in my seat, and I finally busted out and I said, \u201dWell dad, did you have to wear your cow-crap jeans to my assembly?\u201d\n\u00a0\nRobin Bolland (RB): [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nPH: And he said, \u201dLook, everybody knows I\u2019m a dairy farmer. This is who I am.\u201d And he looked me square in the eye. And then he said, \u201dNow, how bout you? When you\u2019re a full-grown man, who are you gonna go out with at night?\u201d And I said, \u201dI don\u2019t know.\u201d And he said, \u201dI think you do know, and it\u2019s not gonna be that McGlaughlin girl that\u2019s been making goo-goo eyes at you but you won\u2019t even pick up the damn telephone.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m gonna tell you something today, and you might not know what to think of it now, but you\u2019re gonna remember when you\u2019re an adult. Don\u2019t sneak. Because if you sneak, like you did today, it means you think you\u2019re doing the wrong thing. And if you run around spending your whole life thinking that you\u2019re doing the wrong thing, then you\u2019ll ruin your immortal soul.\u201d\u00a0 And out of all the things a father in 1959 could have told his gay son, my father tells me to be proud of myself and not sneak.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy reaction at the time was to get out in the hay field and pretend like I was as much of a man as I could be. And I remember flipping 50-pound bales three feet up into the air going, \u201dI\u2019m not a queer. What\u2019s he talking about?\u201d\n\u00a0\nRB: [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nPH: But he knew where I was headed. And he\u2026he knew that making me feel bad about it in any way was the wrong thing to do. I had the patron saint of dads for sissies, and no, I didn\u2019t know at the time, but I know it now.\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMG: Patrick Haggerty remembering his father, Charles Edward Haggerty. Patrick was the founder of Lavender Country \u2013 which he called the world\u2019s first openly gay country band. He died in 2022.\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC CONTINUES]\n\u00a0\nJM: How have you seen things change in the way that we talk about and the way we tell stories from the LGBTQ community?\n\u00a0\nDI: I remember when I did the Stonewall documentary, I was trying to get newspapers to cover it, and I called the major newspaper in New York and said, you know, \u201cwe have this documentary, the first oral history of Stonewall, would you like to do a story about it?\u201d And they said, \u201cwe don\u2019t do stories about those kinds of people.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI like to think that at StoryCorps, we just, you know, whisper truths in people\u2019s ears. And what we try and do is find stories that haven\u2019t been told before that creep up behind you and help you see yourself and someone who you might have thought was very different than you. And I think we\u2019ve done that from the first days of StoryCorps. So I think, you know, nothing\u2019s changed. We just, do our best to, you know, help be the vehicle through which people can have their stories told to the world.\n\u00a0\nMG: More of those stories coming\u2026 after the break. Stay with us\u2026\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\nBREAK\n\u00a0\nJM: Welcome back \u2013 we\u2019re listening to conversations from StoryCorps OutLoud\u2026 our initiative to collect and preserve the stories of LGBTQ people across the country.\n\u00a0\nMG: M.J. Seide fell in love in the early 1990s. Her partner had already been married and raised children\u2026 even grandchildren\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: Which meant that M.J. suddenly became a grandma, too\u2026 Here she is with her 12-year-old granddaughter, Genna Alperin.\n\u00a0\nGenna Alperin (GA): How has your life been different than what you thought it was gonna to be?\n\u00a0\nMJ Seide (MS): I thought that my life was probably not one that was gonna be worth living. There was this hole that I had all of my life because, I never thought I\u2019d be able to walk along the beach and hold somebody\u2019s hand because I\u2019m gay. But, you know, when I fell in love with Mamommy, I knew that she was my soulmate. Do you know what I mean by that?\n\u00a0\nGA: Yeah.\n\u00a0\nMS: I\u2019d never felt that way about anyone before. And um, after she had gotten her divorce from grandpa Jim, she was very upfront with your mom. She told your mom that she was in love, and it was with a woman. And that was the first time that anyone was proud to say that they loved me. That made me the happiest I\u2019d ever been in my life.\u00a0\nAnd then, when I got to know your mom and uncle Justin, I knew that I had hit paradise because I now have a family that I can wrap my arms around.\n\u00a0\nGA: Is there anything that you\u2019ve never told me that you wanna tell me now?\n\u00a0\nMS: You know, you and I talk about most things but this is the first time that we\u2019ve ever talked about the fact that I\u2019m gay and I guess what I wanna ask you is, does it embarrass you to have a gay grandma?\n\u00a0\nGA: No\n\u00a0\nMS: No?\n\u00a0\nGA: It doesn\u2019t really matter\n\u00a0\nMS: It doesn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nGA: It just matters my relationship with you.\n\u00a0\nMS: I always tell you how much I love you, but I don\u2019t know that you can really understand the depth of it, because you\u2019re someone that I never thought would be in my life and I can\u2019t imagine my life without you. You have always been a child that makes up her own mind and, I always knew that you were going to grow up to be a woman that we would all be very, very proud of.\n\u00a0\nGA: Well, um. You\u2019re one of my favorite grandmas. You do, like, a lot of things with me like ride roller coasters and (GA & MS laugh) play poker (GA & MS laugh) I don\u2019t know what life would be like without you here.\n\u00a0\nMS: I love you sweetheart.\n\u00a0\nGA: Love you too.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMG: OutLoud was started to preserve the stories of the pre-Stonewall generation while we still could\u2026 but as it\u2019s continued\u2026 it\u2019s also documented several other generations\u2026 including the youngest one\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: Gabe Lopez always knew he was a boy, even though his birth certificate said otherwise.\n\u00a0\nMG: When he was 8 years old, Gabe came to StoryCorps in Arizona, where he lives, with his mom Chris, and they talked about how a weekend at camp for transgender kids transformed his life.\n\u00a0\nChris L\u00f3pez (CL): Do you remember when things really changed for you?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGabe L\u00f3pez (GL): We went to a camp. And I met three best friends \u2014 Luke, Brock, and Cooper. They were all transgender like me, so they all wanted to be boys. Brock taught me how to pee standing up.\n\u00a0\nCL: (laughs) And that was huge for you, right?\n\u00a0\nGL: Yeah. That\u2019s why I say we\u2019re bros. We know each other.\n\u00a0\nCL: Do you ever get scared about what it\u2019s going to be like to grow up transgender?\n\u00a0\nGL: I\u2019ve been wondering if when I\u2019m older, a lot of people will try to hurt me or something \u2026 or \u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: Like if they find out you were born a girl and they have a problem with it?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Mhmm.\n\u00a0\nCL: You think they might try to hurt you in some way?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: Were you ever worried about telling me that you were transgender?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Yes.\n\u00a0\nCL: Did you ever try to tell me and then change your mind?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Mmhmm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: How many times do you think?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: I think like, four times.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: Four times?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: I was worried that you liked me as a girl.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: Because we used to have a lot of fun?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Mmhmm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: Do we still have fun?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Mhhmm.\n\u00a0\nCL: So it doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re a boy or a girl, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Yeah.\n\u00a0\nCL: I didn\u2019t know that you were dealing with that on your own. If I\u2019d known I would have tried a little bit harder to have that conversation with you, and maybe start it myself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Um, do you worry about me?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCL: I worry about how other people might treat you. And it makes me upset to think about what you might have to go through.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou amaze me every day. And you can tell me anything, anytime, anywhere, and it won\u2019t change how much I love you. I\u2019ll always have your back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Thank you, mom.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMG: That conversation was recorded on our mobile tour in 2015\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd just this year Gabe, who\u2019s now 16 years old\u2026 came back for another conversation. This time with his dad, Julio.\n\u00a0\nLOPEZ UPDATE TAPE\n\u00a0\nGL: Did you ever feel jealous that it was my friends who taught me how to pee standing up?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJL: No, I don\u2019t think so. But I was like, \u201cthat takes some talent to be able to do that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGL: When I first talked to you guys about how I felt, I was young, obviously, but I didn\u2019t know the consequences that people could have for coming out to their parents.\n\u00a0\nJL: We always thought it was just kind of a phase and we told you that, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: Mm-hmm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJL: And I remember saying that to you because it happened with my sister. You know, my sister was very tomboyish and hanging out with the boys but I noticed something different in you. So when you came out to us, it caught us by surprise, but it wasn\u2019t a big surprise. You know what I mean?\n\u00a0\nGL: Yeah. I was really happy that you guys were super supportive, because I know that not many kids get that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJL: We\u2019ve always loved you, no matter what.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLike one of the pictures that I cherish, you were in a dress, you were holding a, a toy gun mm-hmm. And your Hulk shoes\u2026\n\u00a0\nGL: (laughs) \n\nJL: \u00a0\u2026 and I mean, you know,\u00a0 even though that time was still kind of difficult for you.\nI saw who Gabe was and who he was gonna become in the future. I\u2019m always gonna be able to cherish that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow would you describe yourself today?\n\u00a0\nGL: I\u2019m really trying to up my art game, so I can be a tattoo artist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJL: I bought you a tattoo gun. And then told you I can be your test dummy and I love it because, for your first tattoo on a person, that came out really good.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJL: What kind of man do you want to be?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGL: The kind of man that can help others see different viewpoints. And not specifically that they have to agree with that side but they acknowledge that it\u2019s there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat are your hopes for me?\n\u00a0\nJL: I want you to be happy. When I leave here I want you to be OK. That\u2019s all I\u2019m wanting for you.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nDI: I don\u2019t think we have any idea what these stories\u2026what this kind of collection of the wisdom of humanity is going to mean a hundred years from now. But it\u2019s a way to pass wisdom from one generation to the next and it shows the best in us. And that\u2019s one of those, you know, those lessons of StoryCorps; just reminds us of the fundamental goodness of humanity. And we have to trust in that, especially, when we go through rough times, like we\u2019re going through today. But you know, that\u2019s a lesson going back to Stonewall and Sylvia Rivera and, you know, the heroes who fought on that night, that you just can\u2019t give up. And I do believe that good wins in the end.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMG: This episode was produced by Jud Esty-Kendall and Jasmyn Morris with Max Jungreis, Von Diaz, and Kayla Lattimore.

And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again. So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable. And as far as you doing the business? You started younger than me.\nPMJ: As soon as I could walk.\nPM: Even before you were walking.\nPMJ: Yeah, I\u2026\nPM: I\u2019ve got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the basinet.\nPMJ: I was literally there since day one. I saw you do it, I was like, \u201dOk, I can do this.\u201d Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. One half of that is, you know, \u2018cause he\u2019s a great guy, but the other half is, like, he\u2019s the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can\u2019t help.\nPM: I have a sense of usefulness. And that\u2019s a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth.\nPMJ: I\u2019m not just saying this, you\u2019re the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and\u2026\nPM: That comes from coming from immigrant parents. You can never work hard enough. Even when you\u2019re working seven days a week they say, \u201cYou\u2019re a little lazy.\u201d Think about it Philip, when am I ever late?\nPMJ: Never.\nPM: When do I ever take vacations?\nPMJ: No, never.\nPM: And when am I gonna retire?\nPMJ: One day before your funeral? PM: You know it.\nPMJ: Yup. [Laughter]\nPM: You know if you ever didn\u2019t want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken. I would understand.\nPMJ: Yeah, yeah.\nPM: You know what I mean? My father, he hated my business man. You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time. But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: \u201dI\u2019m no genius, but I\u2019m bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.\u201d I like that.\nPMJ: You raised all of us, man. Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man. That\u2019s hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade.\nPM: Well you do your best kid. This is what you do. But honestly your best. Not just your B.S. best. And even if you fail. It doesn\u2019t feel that bad.\nPMJ: You\u2019re always my barometer. You never let anyone down.

{"text": "HOST:\nFor 25 years\u2026 the Lesbian Switchboard operated in New York City\u2026 it was a helpline for women with no one to talk to about being gay\u2026\u00a0\nAnd if you called in the 1980s\u2026 longtime volunteer Denise Tuite [TOOT] might have answered the phone.\u00a0\nAt StoryCorps\u2026 she remembered what this work meant to her.\nDenise Tuite (DT): The Lesbian Switchboard was located in an old school building. The room was a tiny room, and there were no windows. It was very depressing looking, to tell you the truth.\u00a0 It was that old, gray, green color they used to paint schools at that time, so it looked kind of dingy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it was our place. You know, it was beautiful.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTypical calls were, I\u2019m coming to New York, what\u2019s the best\u00a0 bar for lesbians specifically? But then every once in a while you\u2019d get somebody that would call and just want to talk\u2026 Someone from Oshkosh, Wisconsin or something. \u2018Should I tell my parents? Shouldn\u2019t I tell my parents?\u2019\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe suicidal calls we weren\u2019t permitted to take, \u2018cause we weren\u2019t trained for that. I had a few of those calls. \u2018Don\u2019t kill yourself, don\u2019t be ashamed of yourself, call this number.\u2019 That\u2019s all we could say, really.\n\u00a0\nBut I realized much later on, the switchboard was not only me helping other people, it was me helping me.\n\u00a0\nMy family was very close-knit Brooklyn Irish Catholic. Church every Sunday, go to Catholic school\u2026 and I started to realize I was gay, when I was about 14. And believe it or not, at one time I was really pretty (laughs), and I had a boyfriend, but I didn\u2019t want to be with him. And my mother? She wanted me at 16 to marry, so I could get these feelings of being a lesbian out of me.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nShe felt I was a bad influence on my younger brother and sisters. So when I graduated high school, my mother didn\u2019t want me in the house anymore. You know, and I was still like just a kid.\n\u00a0\nIt would have been a hell of a lot easier for me to get married, and have a family and be accepted by my mother, and loved by my mother\u2026which\u2026 is something I wanted. But that wasn\u2019t who I was.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe impact that the switchboard had on me, I realized that a lot of people out there are like me, and now I had to tell them it was okay\u2026 there\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what people wanted to hear. They wanted to hear that no matter where they were, no matter how isolated they were, there are other people like you. You know, you had to tell them that they weren\u2019t alone.\u00a0\n\nClose"},

It was really the only time someone said to me, \u2018I know what you\u2019re feeling, and I know what you\u2019re missing.\u2019 And I felt that things really would be OK.\n\u00a0\nCD: When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died. And you just don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to go on without that person.\n\u00a0\nJC: Many years later, when I became a teacher, I started to think to myself, \u2018Here I am, with a memory of a teacher who changed my life, and I\u2019ve never told her that.\u2019\n\u00a0\nCD: And your letter could not have come at a better time because my husband had Parkinson\u2019s and he was going downhill. And I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed.\n\u00a0\nJC: Well the funny thing is, I typed the letter. I was afraid my penmanship wasn\u2019t going to meet your standards. Well, after all this time, Mrs. Doyle, all I can say to you is, thank you.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHost: Cecile Doyle died in 2019.\n\u00a0\nAfter, John sat down with a different member of the Doyle family\u2026 Cecile\u2019s daughter, Allison.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohn Cruitt (JC) and Allison Doyle (AD)\n\u00a0\nJC: My relationship with you is very important to me. Because all those years I was away from your mother, 54 years, I didn\u2019t know if she was being loved. And when I met you, it made me feel so much better.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo you remember the day we actually had the reunion?\n\u00a0\nAD: To see you standing in the doorway with the flowers, approaching one another\u2026 And instinctively, she gave you a kiss on the forehead.\n\u00a0\nJC: It was an absolutely unbelievable feeling that I had. It was like I was seeing Mrs. Doyle and I was seeing my mother at the same time.\n\u00a0\nAD: We had put a book together of all of the pictures of your reunion, the letter, and she would show friends. And we had that book at her funeral service. So that for me, I think, helped me through my grief\u2026 Because we get wrapped up in the person going and leaving us. And then you realize it\u2019s about what have they left behind.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJC: I\u2019m just so grateful also that, in some small way, I was able to bring her a little bit of joy before it was too late.\n\u00a0\nAD: And that was in a big way John. I almost feel like you\u2019re a brother.\n\u00a0\nJC: I suspect our mothers have something to do with that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAD: They might quite well.

I mean, we live in such a culture of, you know, even when you look at the best seller list, you\u2019ve got these books that are all the way on the right and all the way on the left. And it just seems like everybody is screaming at each other. There\u2019s just this lack of real honest communication and it\u2019s simply about getting people to sit down and talk to each other and listen.\n\u00a0\nBL: So now you\u2019re going to get diehard Democrats and diehard Republicans to the booth to really listen to each other about where their views come from?\n\u00a0\nDI: Hey, you never know. You never know. We hope so.\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMG: 20 years ago\u2026 that sounded like a whimsical idea\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: But that comment would end up being kind of prophetic. In the years since that interview, the divides in this country have grown wider\u2026 and the stakes have gotten much, much higher.\n\u00a0\nMG: Listen to this StoryCorps participant named John Klinkel\u2026 he\u2019s a veteran and he did multiple tours in Afghanistan\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohn Klinkel: I was out of the country from 2009 until about March of 2017. When I got back, the country was almost as angry as some of the factions I remember seeing in Afghanistan. It felt like a country that was always on the verge of either tearing itself, apart or picking a fight. And I didn\u2019t remember that from when I left. So it was very strange for me to come back and feel the anger.\n\u00a0\nIf you think of being in a deployed environment, you want to stay in the yellow light, cautious, ready to go but recognizing that things haven\u2019t jumped off just yet. And it kind of felt like that. It felt like, Ooh, we\u2019re in a situation here. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: Whenever there\u2019s a national crisis or tragedy of some sort\u2026 StoryCorps has always tried to find ways to be helpful.\n\u00a0\nMG: When we started in 2003, New York was still recovering from the September 11 attacks. We offered families who had lost someone that day the opportunity to record their memories\u2026 to make sure their loved ones wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\n\u00a0\nJM: In earlier episodes you heard about how we brought a Mobile Booth to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: And how we built new technology to help connect people during Covid.\n\u00a0\nJM: And so in this final episode we\u2019ll learn what StoryCorps is doing NOW\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: And where we might go in the future\u2026 I\u2019m Michael Garofalo.\n\u00a0\nJM: And I\u2019m Jasmyn Morris. From NPR, this is StoryCorps Then and Now \u2013 celebrating 20 years of StoryCorps.\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMG: That clip youjust\u00a0 heard from the veteran describing what it was like to come back to the US\u2026 that\u2019s from an initiative called One Small Step. Our effort to address just how divided we\u2019ve become.\n\u00a0\nJM: It brings strangers with opposing political beliefs together for a conversation \u2013 not to argue about politics\u2026 but just to learn about each other\u2019s lives.\n\u00a0\n\u200aMBS: We don\u2019t expect them to or even want them or ask them to agree by the end of the conversation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: That\u2019s Mary Bess Ser\u2026. she works on One Small Step.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: We\u2019re not asking people to come to any sort of common ground. We just want people to talk.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Because\u2026 we HAVE stopped talking to each other. A lot of us have a tendency to shut out people we don\u2019t agree with\u2026 so One Small Step asks us to do the opposite\u2026 to actually get to know each other.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: The basis of the whole conversation is, you know, yes, we probably disagree on most things, but we\u2019re having this conversation anyway. And by the end of it, We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: You know, these days the voices telling us that we\u2019re supposed to hate each other are so loud\u2026 and so pervasive\u2026 One Small Step really feels like David taking on Goliath\u2026 but we\u2019ve never shied from a challenge before\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: And there\u2019s scientific evidence that something like this can make a difference. One Small Step is rooted in a psychological concept called Contact Theory.\n\u00a0\nMG: The idea is that under very specific circumstances\u2026 when people who consider themselves enemies are put together one on one\u2026 they can actually come out the other side of that experience understanding and accepting each other\u2026 and sometimes they even become friends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: One of the keys is that phrase \u201cvery specific circumstances\u201d \u2013 so StoryCorps tweaked our interview process to create a space where these conversations can happen.\n\u00a0\nMG: Almost all StoryCorps interviews are between two people who know and care about each other\u2026 but One Small Step interviews are between strangers. Here\u2019s Mary Bess again\u2026\n\u00a0\nMBS: The fact that they\u2019re strangers really makes it less threatening. So say you have a really hard time talking about politics with your mother \u2013 that may or may not be my story \u2013\u00a0 it\u2019s easier to have this conversation with a stranger because there\u2019s no relationship at stake. You come to the table with a clean slate. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Here\u2019s how it works \u2013 people sign up online \u2013 there\u2019s a questionnaire that asks them to rate how they feel about social and economic issues\u2026 how important religion is in their lives\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: They can select from a list of terms to identify themselves\u2026 things like parent, grandparent or veteran.\u00a0 And they write a short bio\u2026 describing themselves in their own words \u2013 and that gets shared with their interview partner.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Then someone from StoryCorps \u2013 like Mary Bess \u2013 matches them up with a stranger.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: There\u2019s a real person doing the pairing\u2026 not an algorithm.\n\u00a0\nMBS: They don\u2019t see the reason why we\u2019ve matched them. Really they show up to the interview, you know, not knowing at all what to expect, and usually people realize that they\u2019ve come to the table with a lot of assumptions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Here\u2019s one example. It comes from Birmingham, Alabama\u2026 where Cassandra Adams, a liberal, was paired with David Wilson, a conservative.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCassandra Adams (CA): Lemme ask you this, when you read my bio\u2026\n\u00a0\nDavid Wilson (DW): Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nCA: What did you think? And please be as honest as you feel comfortable because nothing would bother me.\n\u00a0\nDW: Um, so the first part my mind kicked into stereotype\u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCA: Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nDW: She\u2019s probably dyed in the wool democrat, end of story.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCA: [laughs]\n\u00a0\nDW: Second part was intriguing because you said something along the lines of an open mind and I thought, well this would be interesting.\n\u00a0\nCA: When I read your bio I just thought you were a white man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDW: [laughs]\n\u00a0\nCA: I thought I was gonna come in here and just be like\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDW: [laughs] I don\u2019t even know what it was! I don\u2019t remember what it was!\n\u00a0\nCA: And that\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting to me! Is that I\u2019m just like\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDW: Stereotype!\n\u00a0\nCA: That\u2019s exactly right! So I have to admit it because when you walked in the door and I stood up and introduce myself I was like \u2018oops, oops, oops.\u2019\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMBS: To have this opportunity to match people, like they\u2019re dating, and there\u2019s always some sort of coincidence that we didn\u2019t even know about. One interview, we found out that both participants, I mean, they couldn\u2019t be more different, but they\u2019re both foster parents, and we didn\u2019t know that. That wasn\u2019t even a point of connection where I thought, oh, they\u2019re so different, but they\u2019re foster parents. This will be a great conversation. Nope. I didn\u2019t even know.\u00a0 They had a great time. They wanted to go out for coffee afterwards.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: Yeah. I mean, that really is something, right? Because we\u2019re told constantly, talking about the other side, like, oh, those people, we can\u2019t possibly have anything in common with them, and then it\u2019s amazing to hear that there\u2019s almost always something.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: Yeah, and it can be something completely uninteresting too it could be like, Oh, both of these people are into intermittent fasting, you know, like, (laughs) but they have something to talk about, you know, that, (laughs) and they realize that it\u2019s the shared humanity aspect of it, you know.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\nJM: Here\u2019s Stephanie Hamilton and Dana Coyle from Tucson, Arizona. Their connection\u2026 was parenting.\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: I\u2019ve been stretched and challenged far beyond I knew was possible. You know? And I know when we went from one to two, there was that question, you know, how do you do more than the one? Right? And your heart just seems to have all kinds of elastic in it. It doesn\u2019t ever wear out. Right? You know? (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Pretty amazing.\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: Yeah. So how your parents influenced you were there things that you embraced or as you were parenting your own children?\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: That\u2019s a great question. My dad would say, \u201cWell you can do that if you want. I prefer this.\u201d And he let us see that opportunity for ourselves. I remember when I told him I wanted to try smoking cigarettes. And he said, \u201cWell, I personally prefer to breathe clean air, but if that\u2019s your choice, then you go for it\u201d and took the excitement out of it. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: But, you actually told him that. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Yeah. Yeah.\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: That you had that relationship you could do that.\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Yes. I feel like I lean toward that with my children\n\u00a0\nStephanie Hamilton: You know I think what a gift your father gave you. So I\u2019m very much a daddy\u2019s girl. I connected with him. He was my junior senior high school principal. So 7th through 12th grade. And when I was going into 7th grade, you know, he made sure he had a conversation with me where he said, \u201cYou know, your mom and I think you\u2019re pretty special but, because you\u2019re my daughter, you\u2019re probably going to have few friends and you probably won\u2019t have anybody who will want to date you. And it\u2019s not because you don\u2019t have a lot to offer, but it\u2019s primarily because of whose daughter you are.\u201d The fact that he did that, laid that out for a 12-year-old girl, he set the tone for me to know what the road was going to be like. And we didn\u2019t have a lot of conversations, you know? And I don\u2019t know how often my father ever said I love you, but I know he loved me.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nDana Coyle: Who knew how that was going to go? Like you said, it\u2019s unscripted. We are connected in probably twelve different ways I can think of, right? Like that. Let me give you a hug.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMBS: A lot of people think that, Oh, one small step, these conversations, people are going to attack each other, you know, it\u2019s going to get ugly. And honestly, it\u2019s the opposite.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome people don\u2019t want to participate because they say, well, I don\u2019t really know, I\u2019m not really well versed in what\u2019s going on in politics right now.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s where we say, you know, you don\u2019t have to prepare for this experience. You don\u2019t have to, this isn\u2019t a debate. You don\u2019t need to bring a briefcase full of, you know, the most recent articles. you just bring your life experience and talk about what you care about, what your life has been like and listen to someone else do the same and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\u00a0\nJM: So there ARE some other ways One Small Step interviews are different from standard StoryCorps conversations\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: Each One Small Step interview starts with the participants reading each other\u2019s bios out loud\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: And then a trained facilitator guides them through the conversation with questions from a list designed specifically for One Small Step.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: One of the questions is can you describe in your own words, your personal political values? The way it\u2019s phrased you\u2019re asked to talk about why you care about something, why it\u2019s important to you, why you believe X, Y, or Z. So you\u2019re still talking about your own life. You\u2019re still telling stories, you know, how your grandfather influenced you, or, you know, you grew up poor.\n\u00a0\nMG: It takes politics out of a win and lose sort of binary right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: Right.\n\u00a0\nMG: And makes it about understanding, which is, like, a completely different approach\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMBS: Yeah, I mean you can still walk out of the room and think, you know, that person everything they stand for is completely wrong, but, somehow, I enjoyed speaking with them, or somehow I kind of respect them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: This next conversation comes from Columbus, Georgia\u2026 Alton Russell is the former Chair of the Republican party there\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: And he was paired with Wane Hailes\u2026 who was the President of the local chapter of the NAACP.\n\u00a0\nThese guys knew of each other\u2026 but they had never spoken before this interview.\n\u00a0\nAlton:\u200a I went to Houston looking for a job in this little old bitty office. There was a guy sitting at the desk. He said, um, \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d And I said, \u201cAnything as long as it\u2019s legal.\u201d He says, \u201cGood answer. How about 40 dollars a week?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes sir.\u201d This was 1961. He said, by the way, \u201cMy name is George Bush.\u201d It was George H. W. Bush.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: Really.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Yes, sir. And he was running for Congress. What my job was is I made yard signs with a wooden stake and a piece of poster board and a stencil.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: But you\u2019ve never run for office?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: No, never have.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: You\u2019ve just been the kingmaker.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Well, I don\u2019t know about that. But I, no, I never have run.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: What do you do for a living?\n\u00a0\nAlton: Believe it or not, I\u2019m a toilet paper salesman.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: Really?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Yes, sir.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWayne: Two ply?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Two ply, wipe it up, yeah. I\u2019ve been there 40 years.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWayne: Is that right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Yeah. But you\u2019ve done a lot of different things too, and I\u2019m, I\u2019m just wondering how in the world did you wind up in Columbus, Georgia? Did you take a wrong turn?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: I was working for the YMCA, and the YMCA here called and said, \u201cWould I be interested?\u201d But as the president of the NAACP, I can tell you how I got into that.\n\u00a0\nWhen we were, uh, growing up, about 8 or 9 years old, we were traveling to my grandfather\u2019s house and we stopped at a laundromat. And when we went in,\u00a0 they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t wash black folks clothes here.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nWane: Of course, they didn\u2019t use black folks word. My father being a preacher, you know, he was cool, but my mother was ready to go off, you know, and we went on to my grandfather\u2019s house and he got on the phone and he called the NAACP. About 30 minutes later, they said, going back up to the laundromat. And the white owner stood in the corner while we washed our clothes, red as a beet. So I\u2019m like, Oh man, that was a memory that\u2019s always been in my mind.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Sure.\n\u00a0\nWane: And how it worked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: You know what? I have a good friend of mine. We went to breakfast one morning and when we left this guy that was in the restaurant with us came out and followed me to my truck. And he said, um, \u201cAre you Alton Russell?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d He says, \u201cWell, I saw you on TV the other day.\u201d He said, \u201cBut I got a question. How can you be a Republican and eat breakfast with that black guy?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did you say? That guy\u2019s a friend of mine. You\u2019re way off base.\u201d We got things to do, and worrying about whether you\u2019re a man, a woman, black, or white is not what you need to be focusing on.\n\u00a0\nWane: Yeah. Well I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve got a whole different view of you. You know, my perception was, okay, he\u2019s always going to be over here. I\u2019m not going to even talk with him. But this has been, this has been eye opening for me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: Well, it has to me too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWane: And I can go tell some people, \u201cHey, Alton\u2019s not that bad.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s alright.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlton: It\u2019s been fun. And I\u2019m really glad to have met you; I sure am.\n\u00a0\n[MUSIC]\n\u00a0\nMBS: People have come to believe that these conversations are possible. So that in and of itself, I think, is an increase in hope. And I don\u2019t know if you can quantify it, hope, but, um, you know, the belief that we can have these conversations, especially in an election year, you know, you wonder, well, is this the right time for one small step? And I think it\u2019s even more important at those times because that\u2019s when we most definitely do not want to talk to each other.\n\u00a0\nJM: Remember earlier we mentioned Contact Theory? That idea that if people from different groups come together 1 on 1\u2026 they can start to see each other as human?\n\u00a0\nMG: One Small Step interviews are definitely helping that to happen. But the harder thing to make happen\u2026 is to have that feeling generalize\u2026 to not be just about that one individual you met\u2026 but about a whole group\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Well, there\u2019s a social psychologist at Yale, Jennifer Richeson\u2026 and she\u2019s been studying One Small Step and the impact it\u2019s having on participants\u2026 And she\u2019s finding evidence that\u2026 for some people who record with us\u2026 this feeling IS beginning to generalize.\n\u00a0\nMBS: Sometimes people say, well, I didn\u2019t see fireworks, it didn\u2019t change me, but they really enjoyed the other person\u2019s company and they were surprised by that, or They really felt like they understood each other and that really surprised them. It definitely chips away at that us versus them mentality just a little bit. And, you know, that\u2019s why we say it\u2019s one small step. It\u2019s not a magic cure. We\u2019re not calling it that. It\u2019s just One Small Step in the right direction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: We\u2019ll be back\u2026 right after the break. Stay with us\u2026\n\u00a0\n[Break]\n\u00a0\nMG: So, Jasmyn, here we are\u2026 the last segment of the final episode of this series.\n\u00a0\nJM: We made it\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: Yeah. You know, one of the big takeaways for me looking back on these past twenty years\u2026 it\u2019s related to what Mary Bess said a few minutes ago\u2026 about increasing hope. I think at its root, that\u2019s a big part of what StoryCorps is about\u2026 and I don\u2019t mean like cheap greeting card expressions of hope\u2026 but the kind of hope that grows out of hard work\u2026 and having people surprise you.\n\u00a0\nJM: Yeah, you see that even with One Small Step. Earlier this year, in a \u201cMr Isay Goes to Washington\u201d moment\u2026 Dave brought One Small Step to the annual baseball game between members of Congress at Nationals stadium in DC\u2026 and he showed a video on the jumbotron challenging them to participate\u2026 and some of them actually did\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: And soon we\u2019re rolling out this new do-it-yourself online version of One Small Step, so that strangers anywhere in the country can record an interview. You could have a person from the bluest county in America getting to know someone from the reddest county\u2026 I mean, for me personally at this moment in history\u2026 it\u2019s just really incredible to work at a place where the underlying ethos is optimism.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: Yeah and I think for me having listened to A LOT of StoryCorps interviews over the years\u2026 and it\u2019s really beautiful to hear someone take the time to sit down with another person, especially an elder to capture wisdom from their family\u2026\u00a0 you know, before it\u2019s lost. But for those of who get to do this work\u2026 we\u2019ve been able to listen to thousands of these interviews, thousands of\u00a0 grandparents\u2026 or parents or couples and absorb basically generations of wisdom\u2026 And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever told you this but I actually used to keep a folder of little clips from interviews whenever I heard little gems \u2026 that I just wanted to keep for myself, stuff I could use in my own life. What a gift.\n\u00a0\nMG: Very cool. Another thing that strikes me is that after 20 years\u2026 the basic idea of a StoryCorps interview really hasn\u2019t changed that much\u2026 and I mean that in the best way\u2026 it\u2019s held up\u2026 like no matter what\u2019s going on in the world\u2026 this way of taking an hour to connect with somebody\u2026 we want it\u2026 maybe we even need it.\n\u00a0\nJM: And we found something that really helps illustrate that point. We dug up the very first SC interview ever recorded\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: \u200aI\u2019m Dave Isay, and I\u2019m interviewing Sandy Birnbaum, who\u2019s my uncle, my great uncle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200aSandy Birnbaum (SB): Great Uncle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Sandy, this is a very special session here because, like I said, we\u2019re starting this whole national movement and you\u2019re interview number one.\n\u00a0\nJM: When they spoke in 2003\u2026 Sandy\u2019s wife of 55 years, Birdie, had died just a few months before.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: The first date, she says, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the doorway just past the liquor store after work.\u201d And I was standing in the doorway, and it\u2019s inset a little bit.\u00a0 And finally I see this vision of purple coming down the street, a purple hat and a purple coat, and I think she had purple shoes and stockings on, too and uh, it\u00a0 was so glamorous. I says, What the hell am I, a two bit farm boy? This is such a sophisticated woman. I mean, she\u2019s way beyond me. So I turned to the doorway, and I tried to duck out, but the door was locked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Cries) If the door was open, it would have ended there and the best thing that\u2026 (Cries) Well anyhow, uh, the door was locked and, uh, we had just so much fun.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Birdie was the love of your life?\n\u00a0\nSB: Oh yeah, yeah.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: What did you love about her?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: You know I\u2019ve never been asked that question. Just her warmth. She was everything that I wasn\u2019t. She filled in all the, uh, deficiencies I had, which were considerable, mostly in regard to shyness and to, uh, self confidence and things like that. Everybody loved her, and she was a good person to have with you. Oh God,\u00a0 I remember\u2026\n\u00a0\nDI: Thank you, Sandy. So let me ask you a question. It is helpful to talk about this, yeah?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: Uh.\n\u00a0\nDI: Or is it not?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Is it damaging to bring up?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: Oh, no.. it\u2019s a good feeling. Break out crying or you choke up and you can\u2019t say a word, that\u2019s a good feeling? Yeah, it is. Because, you know, you don\u2019t have to pretend that you\u2019re being a brave soul. (laughs) Gutting it through. You\u2019re just letting go. It\u2019s a good feeling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Let me get you home.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSB: Okay.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Thank you, Sandy.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: Hundreds of thousands of interviews later, it\u2019s hard to imagine how many moments like this exist in the archive.\n\u00a0\nMG: And it\u2019s hard to measure the impact of those moments\u2026on the people who recorded interviews\u2026and also on the people who have helped build StoryCorps\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: So we\u2019re going to leave you with a conversation I recently had with Dave about just that\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: So, for this last episode, looking back on twenty years, so many people have contributed to making StoryCorps what it is now, of course. And we\u2019ve all had life changes. I\u2019ve gotten married, had children in this time.\n\u00a0\nDI: Me too. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nJM: Right! Lots of people have put their whole selves into this work. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Yeah, well, I mean I think that everybody when they leave StoryCorps to a person and, you know, we\u2019ve had thousands of employees at this point over the years, you know, everyone says that the best thing about StoryCorps are the people. The StoryCorps team has never ceased to amaze me and, you know, that\u2019s why we are what we are.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou know, true story and kind of crazy, but our first corporate sponsor was Hebrew National Hot Dogs. I don\u2019t know why. I have absolutely no idea.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nDI: But their, um, motto famously was, We answer to a higher authority and, you know, I think that\u2019s how all of us have felt at StoryCorps over these past 20 years, that this is sacred work and it draws a very special person to do this work. And it\u2019s very hard work. There\u2019s nothing viral or easy about StoryCorps. You know, but it\u2019s drawn people who just refuse to give up and I think that\u2019s part of the secret sauce and the magic of StoryCorps.\n\u00a0\nOne of the original StoryCorps employees\u2013we started with four or five\u2013and one of them was a guy named Matt Ozug. And when he left he said at his goodbye party that \u201cStoryCorps is hard work and love work and blood work.\u201d You know, truer words have never been spoken. But, um, you know, it\u2019s been worth every bit of it, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful to the staff who helped make this dream come true.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: So what are your hopes for the future, for the next 20 years?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Some people have said to me over the years that, you know, if aliens came to earth and they could only find one thing, they hoped it would be the StoryCorps archive because it really, it shows the best in us, but it also shows who we really are and that is the best in us.\n\u00a0\nUm, and I, you know, I hope that the ethos of StoryCorps, that the idea that all of our lives and all of our stories matter equally and infinitely, the idea that we should treat each other with respect, that nobody\u2019s the worst thing they\u2019ve they\u2019ve ever done, that people should be given a second chance that it flows through the veins of the country and participating in StoryCorps and listening to StoryCorps stories becomes part of what it means to be an American and that StoryCorps grows into an institution that outlives us all.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: This episode was produced by MIchael Garofalo, Jud Esty-Kendall, and me.

We called it the Great Thanksgiving Listen\u2026 and it\u2019s actually become a once-a-year tradition.\n\u00a0\nMG: The hope was that we could get enough people to interview each other\u2026 that we\u2019d document an entire generation in one day\u2026 like we said, big ideas.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnyway, the interviews started coming in\u2026 from people\u2019s kitchens, hotel rooms\u2026 and even one from inside a parked car at a strip mall in Iowa\u2026\n\u00a0\nWe asked that person who recorded that one\u00a0 to walk us through that experience\u2026\n\u00a0\nKara Masteller (KM): Hi my name is Kara Masteller and I interviewed my grandfather in my 1994 Buick.\n\u00a0\nKM: How did you know that grandma was the one?\n\u00a0\nJames Kennicott (JK): Well, she was a good looker. (Laughs) We fit together. We were a good pair.\n\u00a0\nKM: My grandma, everyone referred to her as like a spicy meatball. She swore a lot, but she looked so innocent that no one ever expected her to say the things that she said.\n\u00a0\nKM: Were you nervous to propose to her?\n\u00a0\nJK: No. We had something to say, we said it. Like you. (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nKM: What are the keys to a happy marriage?\n\u00a0\nJK: Well if something happens just say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and get it over with. There\u2019s no reason to carry on. I just say \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I love ya,\u2019 and that was the whole story.\n\u00a0\nKM: (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nKM: I was really surprised by my grandpa saying sorry. I\u2019ve never heard him say sorry.\n\u00a0\nKM: How would you like to be remembered?\n\u00a0\nJK: Remem\u2014? Ha. (laughs)\n\u00a0\nKM: Do you want to be remembered as like a real tough guy? Or\u2026\n\u00a0\nJK: Yeah, I was a pretty soft guy.\n\u00a0\nKM: You intimidated me when I was little.\n\u00a0\nJK: I did? (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nKM: Yeah. You did.\n\u00a0\nKM: Are you happy about the life you\u2019ve lived?\n\u00a0\nJK: Oh yeah. It wasn\u2019t the easiest life back in them days. Mother died when I was four. And it was a tough life.\n\u00a0\nKM: He tells one story about how he was eight or nine and he was ice skating on the river and he fell through. He didn\u2019t have hot water wherever he was living with his dad. So he broke into the school and just took a hot shower in the school. I think that says a lot about his childhood that there was really no one there to help him get out of the water or keep him warm.\n\u00a0\nLast April he was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, and I had never really heard him say much about it.\n\u00a0\nKM: What do you think about Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\u00a0\nJK: Not much you can do. I even can\u2019t remember some names now myself. (Laughs) So maybe I have got it. I don\u2019t know.\n\u00a0\nKM: And when he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what it would be like to have it.\u2019 That was difficult for me. So then I had to ask a follow-up just out of, I don\u2019t know, self-preservation because I thought I was gonna cry.\n\u00a0\nKM: As people age, do you have any advice for them as they get older?\n\u00a0\nJK: It\u2019s coming.\n\u00a0\nKM: (Laughs)\n\u00a0\nJK: Don\u2019t fight it. Just roll with. I mean real life. Live it. It\u2019s wonderful.\n\u00a0\nKM: (Laughs) Thank you grandpa.\n\u00a0\nKM: After the interview my grandpa and I talked a lot more. The last thing he said\u00a0\n(laughs) before we got out of the car was, \u2018Let\u2019s give \u2018em hell kiddo.\u2019\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: That\u2019s Kara Masteller with her grandfather James Kennicott from her 1994 Buick in an Iowa parking lot\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: Before this\u2026 StoryCorps typically had been recording about 7,000 interviews a year. But with the app\u2026 on the Sunday after Thanksgiving\u2026 17,000 interviews were added to the archive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe app made it possible for people to record even if their hometown wasn\u2019t a stop on the StoryCorps tour\u2026 which is important\u2026 because some conversations can\u2019t wait. Dave Isay knew that first hand\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDI: Ten years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad. I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago, when my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health, was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away very suddenly a few days later.\n\u00a0\nI listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died. I have a couple of young kids at home, and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session. I thought I couldn\u2019t believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did, but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings. Every day, people come up to me and say, \u201dI wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother, but I waited too long.\u201d Now, no one has to wait anymore.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: And we saw people using the app in this way, like Eva Vega-Olds\u2026 In 2015, her father Leonardo was diagnosed with lung cancer. After going through chemo unsuccessfully\u2026 he went into hospice care at his home in New Jersey. And Eva used the app to preserve his voice\u2026\n\u00a0\nEva Vega-Olds (EVO): When I was recording my dad, I was in his bedroom that he shared with my mom. There was the hospital bed in there, he had an oxygen machine, and he was struggling to breath, but I said, \u201cDad, do you want to do an interview?\u201d And he said, \u201cLet her rip,\u201d and so we did.\n\u00a0\nEVO: Daddy, where were you born?\n\u00a0\nLeonardo Vega (LV): Puerto Rico.\n\u00a0\nEVO: And do you know how long you\u2019ve been in New Jersey?\n\u00a0\nLV: Sixty-five years. I\u2019ve been here all my life.\n\u00a0\nEVO: He was a factory worker, worked the graveyard shift, you know so he\u2019s leaving for work when we\u2019re coming back from school. And then later on, he was a custodian and he was always working.\n\u00a0\nEVO: How do you want to be remembered?\n\u00a0\nLV: I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\u00a0\nEVO: Well I plan on telling the kids that you were really loyal, a committed father\u2026 funny\u2026\n\u00a0\nEVO: My family\u2019s the kind of family that if you can\u2019t take sarcasm, forget about it. Like my wedding day, I remember walking down the aisle, and my dad was walking like super slow. And I\u2019m like, \u201cDad!\u201d And he says to me, \u201cShhh, it\u2019s my day. I finally get rid of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEVO: Do you remember teaching me how to swim?\n\u00a0\nLV: Mm-hmm\u2026\n\u00a0\nEVO: I remember you throwing me in the water and I was screaming and crying like I was gonna drown. And I was like, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t swim!\u201d And then you yelled at me, \u201cWell then just stand up\u201d (laughs.) Do you remember that?\n\u00a0\nLV: Yes.\n\u00a0\nEVO: When we took him home, he came back to hospice care and the nurses were there. He looked at me and he said, \u201cI think they think I\u2019m gonna die.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, if you feel differently then do differently.\u201d But every day he got weaker and closer to the end.\n\u00a0\nEVO: Do you think you\u2019re dying?\n\u00a0\nLV: Everybody dies.\n\u00a0\nEVO: Up until that moment, we had not talked about him dying.\n\u00a0\nEVO: Are you afraid?\n\u00a0\nLV: \u00a0No.\n\u00a0\nEVO: I wish it wasn\u2019t happening right now. What are you most proud of Daddy?\n\u00a0\nLV: My kids.\n\u00a0\nEVO: Your kids?\n\u00a0\nLV: My family.\n\u00a0\nEVO: Okay, let me end it for now\u2026\n\u00a0\nEVO: I did the interview Tuesday afternoon and he passed on Thursday night. You know, not for nothing but my dad\u2019s a working class fellow, he bought a home, paid off his home, and was able to die in his home, with his family around him. For him, that was the pinnacle of what your life should be. And I think that he did achieve his dreams.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMG: Coming up after the break\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMartin Olson (MO): StoryCorps\u2019 whole business model, if you will, is getting two people together in an enclosed space to talk right at each other, which, you know, when there\u2019s a global respiratory pandemic is, you know, not great.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStay with us\u2026\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\n[Break]\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJM: When the entire world came to a halt in March of 2020\u2026 so did StoryCorps\u2026\n\u00a0\nMO: We all were kind of like, what the heck do we do?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: That\u2019s Martin Olson, the director of digital at StoryCorps \u2013 he\u2019s the guy behind the scenes who keeps things like our app and the archive running. And in the early days of Covid\u2026 when suddenly no one could sit down together for an interview anymore\u2026 he had to kind of figure out how to keep StoryCorps itself running.\n\u00a0\nMO: I remember we were still at the StoryCorps offices and Dave just came by and, sort of, started chatting. He was just like, \u201cCan we do anything remote?\u201d And, you know, obviously looking a little bit panicked. Like, How can we actually do something that helps bring people together in this crazy moment? I had actually been messing around a little bit with remote recording, and, at that point, Zoom had entered people\u2019s lives very quickly. You know, here we come, a non-profit with a two person digital team and we\u2019re like, \u201cCool, we\u2019re going to build a thing. Trust us, it\u2019ll work.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMG: And just like that\u2026another \u201cbig idea\u201d was born\u2026\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: And I remember over a weekend basically sat down and banged together like a little basic prototype. Two people with browsers can see each other; they can talk to each other. We can record this audio and then we can get that to talk to our archive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: You know, that weekend where you sat down to just be like, I gotta build this thing? I mean, are you hunched over your computer til three in the morning, like, how are you doing this?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: Yeah, I guess coffee is an occupational hazard of being both a computer nerd and Swedish\u2013actually my son\u2019s first word was kaffe, which is, uh, coffee in Swedish. So thankfully that kept me going, but honestly it was a little bit sort of piece by piece, right? It\u2019s like, alright well, Okay so I\u2019ve got one window and I can see myself in that one and I can see myself in this one. Great. Check. Okay, so they need to hit a record button. Alright so we\u2019ll add that. Did it work? Crap it didn\u2019t work. Alright, doop, doop, doop\u2026Try a thing. You realize that you forgot a semicolon somewhere because it\u2019s two in the morning. It\u2019s a little bit of just sort of trying your way forward sometimes, until you sort of look up and you\u2019re like oh, I should probably go to bed or I\u2019m gonna be a little groggy tomorrow.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: So was all of this exciting for you as, like, a nerdy tech guy? Or was it terrifying?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: Yeah, I resent the premise of the question as a nerdy tech guy, but\u2026\n\u00a0\nJM: Hey, I\u2019m using your words. (laughs)\n\u00a0\nMO: As a highly socially competent tech guy.\n\u00a0\nI don\u2019t remember a moment where I kinda walked in and it was like, you know, Shark Tank and I was like, \u201cDave, here\u2019s my prototype.\u201d I think it was more like, \u201clook I put this thing together; it seems like this is a thing we can do.\u201d Next thing I know it\u2019s got a name called StoryCorps Connect. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhen can we get this thing done?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: You\u2019ve got 48 hours\u2026\n\u00a0\nMO: Well no\u2026yeah right. It was a lot faster than you\u2019d really wanna do this kind of thing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it was not like a single \u2018just me\u2019 effort. There was a lot of different people involved. At the time I also worked with another great guy named Steven on our technology team, so a lot of the early interviews are he and I testing internally.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMartin: Yeah, so this is a recording from my phone. And I guess the real question is how is this going to come out on the other side. Will it come out at all? Let\u2019s see what happens.\n\u00a0\nMO: We\u2019ve gotta see if this thing records so I\u2019ve gotta sit there and just record myself I guess. And so there\u2019s a lot of me just like doo doo doo doo doo, you know,\u00a0 into the thing and like\u2026\n\u00a0\nMartin: Doo doo doo, <whistling, beats playing>\n\u00a0\nMO: Before we released it more widely, we actually have a whole raft of interviews that were staff members calling family members.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: And this includes you\u2026\n\u00a0\nMO: Yeah. So I\u2019ve got one with my sister.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: So hey, how\u2019s it going?\n\u00a0\nSara: It\u2019s going alright, how are you?\n\u00a0\nMO: Ah you know, stressing out. Because this thing tomorrow, in theory, this thing is going to go live and I basically built it in two weeks [Laughs]\n\u00a0\nSara: Are we testing it?\n\u00a0\nMO: Yeah, we\u2019re testing it.\n\u00a0\nJM: After lots of testing and fixing StoryCorps Connect on the fly\u2026 we opened it up to the public\u2026and\u2026 people started to use it.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nJB: When did you realize COVID-19 was serious?\n\u00a0\nEvette Jourdain: My anxiety levels are always on 10. I pray on my way to work, I pray on my lunch break. What keeps me going is the fact that I need to keep goin.\n\u00a0\nCraig Boddie: I fear whenever I leave the house. Everyday I wake up and just wonder, \u2019Is this the day that COVID-19 is gonna come home with me?\u2019\n\u00a0\nMichelle Dawn-Huston: I\u2019ve lost several people over these last couple months that I wasn\u2019t able to say goodbye to, and so that has been really hard.\n\u00a0\nJK: One of the things I miss most is giving you a hug. And uh, when this is all over it\u2019s, uh, one of the things I wanna do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: I remember we had this feeling like, you know, this is this important moment, not only do we need to be here to, you know, help people connect, but also, you know, to document this moment when all of a sudden people found themselves in this new alien world, right?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\nJM: This new world was scary, unknown, and lonely\u2026because the only thing worse than not seeing loved ones\u2026 was the possibility of exposing them to the virus\u2026\n\u00a0\nMG: Dr. Roberto Vargas was the Director of Microbiology at a hospital in Rochester, New York. When the pandemic hit he found himself working long hours in the lab\u2026 running countless COVID tests.\n\u00a0\nBecause of the risk\u2026 and for the sake of his wife and four kids\u2026 he started living in a hotel near his lab\u2026 and then later in the basement of their house.\n\u00a0\nJM: That\u2019s where he was for this StoryCorps Connect recording\u2026 with his wife, Susan, and their 10-year-old son, Xavier, directly upstairs from him\u2026 but speaking through their computers.\n\u00a0\nRoberto Vargas (RV): When I would go to the hotel room after a long day and it was just me there, and it was very quiet; that was when I missed you all the most.\n\u00a0\nXavier Vargas (XV): It got very worrying once I knew the virus was going to be, like, a big thing, and with you gone it was way harder. I just missed you.\n\u00a0\nSusan Vargas (SV): I remember you\u2019d dropped groceries off and put them on the front porch, and that\u2019s when we started talking through the window next to our front door. You would talk on your cell phone, and the kids and I would sit behind the window. And I remember one of the hardest nights, I think you were just exhausted, you just had your head on the window and were crying.\n\u00a0\nBut eventually, you started sleeping in the basement. And I would not let the kids go past the top of the basement stairs.\n\u00a0\nXV: We had to stay far away but I just felt better that you could be, like, a part of us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRV: Mm-hmm.\n\u00a0\nXV: It\u2019s still very hard but it\u2019s just nice to see you, Dad.\n\u00a0\nRV: You have been so helpful to mom, so thank you, ok?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nXV: Thanks.\n\u00a0\nSV: I remember, once you came into the basement, the best night I had yet, you know, your coworker had made all these different dishes for us. You sat at the bottom of the stairs in a rocking chair, and I was at the top.\n\u00a0\nRV: I remember that, yes. I even remember the food; it smelled so good.\n\u00a0\nSV: It was the first time we had been able to connect in so long and, as crazy as it sounds, it\u2019s the best date I\u2019ve ever had with you in my life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRV: Without you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what I\u2019ve been able to do at work. You have to be absolutely everything to our four beautiful kids. I\u2019ve never loved you more and I know it hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\u00a0\nXV: Can you guys try not to cry, it makes me sad when you cry.\n\u00a0\nSV, RV: [Laugh]\n\u00a0\nSV: Oh sorry, honey. These are tears of happiness.\n\u00a0\nSV: Roberto, I admire you so much\u2013always admired you\u2013but you\u2019ve done things these\u00a0\npast couple months that seem impossible.\n\u00a0\nRV: What you\u2019re doing is a lot harder than what I\u2019m doing, a lot harder.\n\u00a0\nXV: Dad, I just want to say thank you for helping get rid of this virus.\n\u00a0\nRV: That\u2019s a team effort and that team includes you. But what carries me through is this family.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: StoryCorps was always really about people talking to each other and looking back, sort of saying, like, where did you grow up? How did you get to this place? During that time though we actually have so much of people just connecting with each other and saying, like, so how has this been for you? How is this currently going? These basic realities of, like, figuring out how to be around each other, how to find toilet paper, you know, which, remember that?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: God yeah.\n\u00a0\nMO: That was fun.\n\u00a0\nMG: At this point, it\u2019s been more than half a year that we\u2019ve been living in isolation\u2026 and then Thanksgiving comes along\u2026 a holiday where we\u2019re all supposed to get together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: So once again, the question was\u2026 what do we do?\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\nMG: There was an older story from before the pandemic\u2026about a vacuum repair guy from Melrose, Massachusetts named Scott MacCaulay\u2026 and he hosts Thanksgiving dinner for strangers. We thought maybe he\u2019d have the answer\u2026Here\u2019s his original story from 2010\u2026\n\u00a0\nScott Macaulay (SM): My folks decided to get divorced. And if you were nice to one, the other one would get mad with you. When October came, I thought, gee, you know, what\u2019s going to happen at Thanksgiving?\n\u00a0\nSo I just thought, well, there must be some other people that are in the same boat. Why should they have that rotten feeling? Why should they be stuck home alone? So, I put an ad in the local paper and offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner for twelve people. People came and they had a good time. And, last year 84 people showed up. What I do is transform the hall at the First Baptist Church to look as close to home as I can get it. I have a fake fireplace. I have Norman Rockwell\u2019s famous Thanksgiving picture framed. And the way I test my success or failure is how long they stay.\n\u00a0\nLast year, I had a family show up two hours late. He had lost his job and they had heard about the dinner and wanted something to eat. And, some of these people might not have anything, but they always find something that they can be grateful for. My goal is always to have nobody sign up, \u2019cause that means everybody\u2019s got a place to go and everybody\u2019s okay. And that\u2019s what keeps me going twenty-five years later.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC>\n\u00a0\nMG: So in 2020\u2026we reached back out to Scott to see how he was dealing with this new reality.\n\u00a0\nJM: Well, turns out\u2026instead of hosting an in-person event\u2026 Scott partnered with a local restaurant to give away free meals from the window of his vacuum repair shop.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC OUT>\n\u00a0\nMG: Using StoryCorps Connect, Scott spoke with his friend Loretta Saint-Louis, who he met during one of his dinners.\n\u00a0\nLoretta Saint-Louis (LSL): I was new to Melrose and I didn\u2019t really know people here. And I saw the advertisement. I think it was in the paper. And it took a bit of courage for me to just call you.\n\u00a0\nSM: What was your first impression of this crazy guy on the other end of the phone?\n\u00a0\nLSL: You were so friendly. I was blown away, all the care that you put into it. It felt like I was going to a family Thanksgiving event. And I\u2019m going to miss that a lot.\n\u00a0\nSM: Yeah, because of the COVID-19 crisis. I\u2019ve offered people alternatives to us getting together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLSL: It\u2019s nice to know that you still want to feed us, but it\u2019s the togetherness of it that\u2019s important.\n\u00a0\nSM: You know, all the people that come \u2026they are young and old, male, female from different places, backgrounds, and countries. And what I find always interesting is despite the great differences, they all have similar things that they\u2019re thankful for. And some of them will make you cry. Somebody will say their son\u2019s now speaking to them. You know, no matter what your condition is, health-wise, financial, or newly divorced, or newly widowed, they focus for some time on good things. And I think that\u2019s\u00a0\nwonderful.\n\u00a0\nLSL: What advice do you have for people who will be alone this year?\n\u00a0\nSM: I would say call everybody and anybody that you can think of tell them, \u201cI love you.\u201d Don\u2019t talk with your mouth full, you know, we don\u2019t want spraying turkey all over the computer screen or the phone. But connect with as many people that you think might be alone or would appreciate a call and tell them you\u2019re thinking of them.\n\u00a0\nMy philosophy is: I can\u2019t fix the country or the world or even the town, but I can brighten my own corner. It doesn\u2019t matter what any of the differences that we can divide ourselves with, if your neighbor\u2019s house is burning down, you run to put the fire out. I\u2019m not going to sit around, talk about it. I\u2019m just going to do something about it. And that\u2019s sort of what the Thanksgiving dinner is all about. That would be my hope for America, that everybody would just brighten the corner where they are.\n\u00a0\n<MUSIC> Vittoro by Blue Dot Sessions\n\u00a0\nMG: We checked in with Scott again this year, and he\u2019s still running those takeaway dinners. Last year, he served 100 people.\n\u00a0\nMO: It was just a weird weird time. You know, and\u2026 It is so bananas to think back to it now. But I really do think that it generally felt, just, good to do something. And I\u2019m the first person to say that technology is not the solution to a lot of problems. But it is nice when there is something where, like, you can think of a way to do something that just wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise. And, again, hopefully, if you\u2019ve done your job right, the technology somewhat melts away, and it\u2019s just communication. It\u2019s just people.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJM: And it continues today.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMO: Yeah. It\u2019s still what we use to record, you know, a lot of interviews. And it\u2019s really opened us up to connect people who have something to say to each other but they\u2019re not in the same place.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI always used to joke with people that whenever there\u2019s a zombie apocalypse, right, I\u2019m not going to be much use because a lot of my skills have to do with plugging things together and, like, electronics and computers. But in this case, all these computer nerdy skills actually came in handy when it had to actually wire things together. So you know, that was nice.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMG: That\u2019s all for this week\u2019s episode. It was produced by Max Jungreis and Jud Esty-Kendall.
